Abstract
The transformation of unstructured legal contracts into standard-
ized, machine-readable formats is essential for automating finan-
cial workflows. The Common Domain Model (CDM) provides a
standardized framework for this purpose, but converting complex
legal documents like Credit Support Annexes (CSAs) into CDM
representations remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we
present an extension of the CDMizer framework, a template-driven
solution that ensures syntactic correctness and adherence to the
CDM schema during contract-to-CDM conversion. We apply this
extended framework to a real-world task, comparing its perfor-
mance with a benchmark developed by the International Swaps
and Derivatives Association (ISDA) for CSA clause extraction. Our
results show that CDMizer, when integrated with a significantly
smaller, open-source Large Language Model (LLM), achieves com-
petitive performance in terms of accuracy and efficiency against
larger, proprietary models. This work underscores the potential of
resource-efficient solutions to automate legal contract transforma-
tion, offering a cost-effective and scalable approach that can meet
the needs of financial institutions with constrained resources or
strict data privacy requirements.

The digitization and standardization of legal agreements are fun-
damental steps toward automating complex financial workflows,
such as collateral management, regulatory reporting, and trade pro-
cessing. In this paper, we focus on Credit Support Annexes (CSAs),
which are integral components of ISDA Master Agreements that
govern collateral management in over-the-counter (OTC) deriva-
tives markets. They define critical terms such as eligible collateral,
thresholds, and minimum transfer amounts, directly shaping coun-
terparty risk exposure. However, CSAs are drafted in unstructured
legal text, making them difficult to interpret consistently across
institutions. This lack of standardization hinders automation, slows
regulatory reporting, and increases operational risk. Digitizing
CSAs into machine-readable, schema-adherent formats is there-
fore essential for enabling scalable collateral workflows, ensuring
compliance, and improving transparency in financial markets.
The industry standard for this digital transformation is theCDM,
a standardized, machine-readable blueprint for financial products,
trades, and their lifecycle events [ 2]. Although the CDM provides a
clear structure, converting unstructured legal agreements like CSAs
from the over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives market into accurate
CDM representations is still a major challenge. Significant industry
efforts, including recent benchmarking work [ 4] by ISDA, are cur-
rently dedicated to addressing this complex conversion challenge.
Additionally, recent advancements in LLMs and Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) offer promising avenues for automating this con-
version. However, two major challenges persist, particularly for
financial institutions:
•Schema and Syntactical Adherence:Direct generation by LLMs
often struggles to consistently produce complex, deeply
nested JSON outputs that adhere strictly to the precise CDM
schema, leading to validation errors and integration issues.
•Accessibility and Cost:Industry-leading benchmarks for con-
tract digitization have demonstrated high accuracy predomi-
nantly through the use of very large, proprietary LLMs (e.g.,
GPT-4o, Claude Opus) [ 4]. These models pose significant
cost, data privacy, and deployment challenges that restrict
their immediate adoption by many institutions, underscoring
the need for competitive, open-source alternatives.
To address the adherence challenge, we previously introduced
CDMizer[ 7], a template-driven framework that enforces syntactic
correctness and schema adherence during the contract-to-CDM
conversion process. CDMizer employs a recursive traversal ap-
proach, integrating RAG, to populate pre-generated, minimal CDM
templates based on hierarchical context. In its initial application,arXiv:2510.23990v1  [cs.IR]  28 Oct 2025
Conference’17, July 2017, Washington, DC, USA Mridul and Seneviratne
CDMizer was used for converting OTC derivative contracts, demon-
strating its ability to handle complex financial agreements and
structure them within the CDM framework.
In this work, we build upon the CDMizer framework to tackle
the accessibility and cost challenge by applying it to a critical, real-
world task defined by ISDA. Specifically, we perform a rigorous
comparative analysis using theQwen3-30B1, which is a state-
of-the-art, yet significantly smaller and open-source-compatible
model, against the published performance of proprietary LLMs on
the ISDA CSA benchmark.
The core contributions of this paper are:
•Methodology Generalization:We validate the application
of the CDMizer framework for accurately encoding ISDA
CSA clauses, extending its use to a new document type be-
yond its initial application to OTC derivative contracts.
•Resource-Efficient Benchmarking:We quantify the per-
formance of CDMizer when integrated with the highly resource-
efficient Qwen3-30B model, providing a benchmark for acces-
sible, internal deployment in comparison to larger models.
•Performance vs. Accessibility Trade-offs:We analyze the
semantic accuracy gap between our resource-constrained
approach and commercial State-of-the-Art (SOTA) models,
highlighting a practical approach to CDM conversion that
balances cost and data privacy constraints.
2 Related Work
The automation of legal contract transformation into standardized
formats has been explored with the use of LLMs and RAG. However,
most research has focused on structured contracts, leaving the
conversion of unstructured financial documents, like CSAs, largely
unaddressed.
Early efforts in automating OTC derivatives, such as [ 3] and [ 1],
relied on structured inputs, addressing only specific tasks like au-
tomating termination procedures or transforming standardized
agreements into smart contracts. These works did not explore the
challenges of handling unstructured legal text in complex contracts.
In contract generation, LLMs have been applied to simpler con-
tracts, like those in [ 5] and [ 10], but these studies focused on do-
mains like health insurance, which lack the complexity of financial
agreements. [ 6] explored contract translation for blockchain using
structured representations but did not tackle unstructured legal
language.
The integration of RAG has proven useful in improving LLM-
generated content, as demonstrated by [ 8], which enhanced the
accuracy and coherence of contract generation. This approach is
particularly valuable for financial contracts, where extracting struc-
tured information from unstructured text is critical. However, ex-
isting evaluation methods, such as those used in [ 5] and [ 9], fall
short when it comes to assessing the complex and nuanced nature
of financial contracts.
In our previous work [ 7], we introduced the CDMizer framework
to address these challenges by applying a template-driven approach
to convert OTC derivative contracts into CDM representations.
This method ensured syntactic correctness and schema adherence,
making it effective for simpler derivative contracts. This paper

and evaluating its performance against an industry benchmark.
3 Experimental Setup
Our experimental approach leverages the core architecture ofCD-
Mizer[ 7] to execute the contract-to-CDM conversion task. As
outlined in the workflow diagram shown in Figure 1, the process
follows three distinct stages - 1) creating templates specific to the
target CSA clauses from the CDM schema and relevant examples, 2)
populating these templates using the chosen LLM, and 3) evaluating
the generated CDM outputs.
Figure 1: Overall Experimental Workflow
3.1 Template Creation and Scope
We focused on the five critical CSA clauses identified in the ISDA
benchmarking study [ 4]:Base Currency, Eligible Currency,
Rounding, Minimum Transfer Amount (MTA), and Thresh-
old.
As detailed in the methodology of the CDMizer framework [ 7],
template creation is a deterministic process (Algorithm 1 in the cited
work). It involves recursively traversing the full CDM schema and
pruning all fields not relevant to the target clauses, resulting in a
minimal, syntactically correct JSON structure. This process yielded
four unique templates: one for the combinedBase Currencyand
Eligible Currencyfields, and one each forRounding,MTA, and
Threshold. This template-driven structure guarantees that the out-
put JSON will always be compliant with the defined CDM schema,
thus achieving100%syntactical correctness and schema adherence,
an advantage over direct generation methods.

billion total parameters (and approximately3 .3billion active param-

compared to the proprietary SOTA models used in the ISDA bench-
mark (e.g., those estimated to be over100billion parameters). Our
primary goal is to assess the utility of this highly accessible model
through the CDMizer framework for this complex, domain-specific
task.
We tested two configurations for each clause:
(1)Without RAG:The LLM receives only the clause-specific
template, the schema definition, and the natural language
contract text.
(2)With RAG:The LLM receives the prompt augmented with
contextual examples retrieved from a RAG knowledge base.
For RAG implementation, the knowledge base consisted of the60
ground truth CSA examples. We employed aleave-one-outapproach:
when processing a given CSA, we excluded it from the retrieval pool
and instead allowed the RAG system to draw contextual examples
only from the remaining59. In other words, each contract was
evaluated as if it were a “new” unseen document, while the model
could still learn patterns from similar but different CSAs. This
ensured that no CSA was ever evaluated against its own ground
truth, preserving fairness and preventing information leakage.3.3 Dataset and Evaluation
Dataset:We used a dataset of60real-world CSA samples, which
are the same source contracts leveraged in the ISDA benchmark-
ing study [ 4]. Using this dataset ensures direct comparability with
industry-standard benchmarks and provides a realistic assessment
of performance on authentic legal documents. Note that theThresh-
oldclause was applicable to37of the samples, resulting in a smaller
test count for that clause.
Evaluation Metrics:The accuracy of the generated CDM out-
puts was assessed through manual, human evaluation, mirroring
the ISDA benchmark’s methodology to ensure consistency and rel-
evance. We manually compared the generated CDM JSON against
the ground truth for each clause and assigned a final score on a
scale of0to100. The ground truth data for these CSA samples
was human-annotated by ISDA experts, making it a reliable source
of reference for evaluating the performance of our model. The
evaluation score reflects:
•Correct schema usage (which CDMizer already guarantees).
•Correct extraction of the target information from the con-
tract text.
•Correct placement and representation of the extracted values
(e.g., currency codes, numeric values, party names) within
the structured CDM fields.

4 Results and Discussion
The results of our evaluation are benchmarked against models
tested by ISDA’s benchmarking work [ 4], ranging from large pro-
prietary models (e.g., GPT-4o, ∼200B) to open-source alternatives
(e.g., Llama 3.3, 70B). The full comparison is detailed in Table 1 and
Table 2.
Despite being significantly smaller, the Qwen3-30B model demon-
strated competitive performance in CSA-to-CDM conversion. A key
strength of the CDMizer framework is its template-driven approach,
which guarantees strict schema adherence. This was particularly
advantageous when using a smaller model like Qwen3-30B, as it
ensured accurate, structured outputs, which are often challenging
for direct LLM generation, especially with complex documents like
CSAs.
A noteworthy result was seen in the MTA clause: when RAG
was not used, Qwen3-30B ranked first in performance. This was
primarily due to the CDMizer framework’s strict schema adherence,which ensured the correct structure of the output, boosting its
score even when compared to larger models. For more standardized
clauses like Base and Eligible Currency and Rounding, Qwen3-30B
also performed strongly, although larger models like GPT-4o and
Claude achieved higher scores across most of the clauses.
When RAG was incorporated, it enhanced the performance of
all models, with the most significant improvement observed in
Qwen3-30B. RAG helped increase semantic coverage and extrac-
tion accuracy, especially for more complex clauses. However, even
without RAG, the Qwen3-30B model was able to achieve competi-
tive results, showcasing the potential of smaller open-source models
for contract digitization.
Overall, CDMizer with Qwen3-30B, while not ranking at the
top in all aspects, achieved scores close to the highest-performing
models, demonstrating its ability to generate syntactically correct
and semantically meaningful CDM representations on par with
larger models, all while remaining computationally efficient. This
positions CDMizer as a resource-efficient solution for CSA-to-CDM
conversion, demonstrating the framework’s broader applicability
beyond its initial use for derivatives contracts.
5 Conclusion
In this work, we extended the CDMizer framework [ 7] to address
the CSA-to-CDM conversion, utilizing the Qwen3-30B model and
benchmarking its performance against the ISDA standard. Despite
its smaller size, Qwen3-30B with CDMizer showed competitive
results, especially when integrated with RAG, achieving accuracy
levels close to those of larger models. This highlights the poten-
tial of resource-efficient solutions for automating contract digitiza-
tion at scale without compromising on performance. Future work
could focus on expanding CDMizer to handle a broader range of
legal documents, enhancing the framework’s generalization capa-
bilities. Additionally, exploring advanced fine-tuning techniques
for domain-specific tasks and incorporating additional contextual
knowledge could enhance the framework’s robustness, further im-
proving the accuracy and reliability of the conversion process.
