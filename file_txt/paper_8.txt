Abstract
Compliance at web scale poses practical challenges: each request
may require a regulatory assessment. Regulatory texts (e.g., the
General Data Protection Regulation, GDPR) are cross-referential
and normative, while runtime contexts are expressed in unstruc-
tured natural language. This setting motivates us to align semantic
information in unstructured text with the structured, normative
elements of regulations. To this end, we introduceGraphCom-
pliance, a framework that represents regulatory texts as a Policy
Graph and runtime contexts as a Context Graph, and aligns them.
In this formulation, the policy graph encodes normative structure
and cross-references, whereas the context graph formalizes events
as subject–action–object (SAO) entity–relation triples. This align-
ment anchors the reasoning of a judge large language model (LLM)
in structured information and helps reduce the burden of regula-
tory interpretation and event parsing, enabling a focus on the core
reasoning step. In experiments on 300 GDPR-derived real-world
scenarios spanning five evaluation tasks, GraphCompliance yields
4.1–7.2 percentage points (pp) higher micro-F1 than the case of
LLM-only and RAG baselines, with a reduced tendency toward
under- and over-prediction, resulting in a higher recall and lower
false positive rates. Ablation studies indicate contributions from
each graph component, suggesting that structured representations
and a judge LLM are complementary for normative reasoning.

(GDPR)1 Introduction
Automatingregulatory compliancefor web-scale systems has be-
come imperative as services continuously ingest personal data,
orchestrate third-party models, and operate across jurisdictions
governed by texts such as the General Data Protection Regulation
(GDPR) [ 1]. The task remains difficult because legal norms are
densely interlinked, actor- and scope-sensitive, and often hinge
on exceptions and derogations that must be traced across arti-
cles and recitals—traditionally treated as a logic-heavy verifica-
tion problem rather than mere text matching [ 9]. In modern web
ecosystems—where platforms broker user data across services and
APIs—accountable, auditable compliance is foundational to trust-
worthy web operation [29].
Effective reasoning about regulatory compliance demands two
key capabilities: 1)semantic understandingto interpret the nu-
ances of unstructured contexts and 2)structural reasoningto
navigate scopes, exceptions, and cross-references [ 3]. Recent large
language models (LLMs), along with reasoning pipelines that use
them, such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), excel at the
former but struggle to ensure the verifiability required for the lat-
ter due to their black-box nature [ 16,24]. Conversely, structured
representations like graphs capture structural relationships explic-
itly but face limitations in interpreting the rich semantic details of
natural language [ 12]. A natural attempt to resolve this dilemma
is to leverage graphs to assist LLM reasoning, as in frameworks
such as GraphRAG, which use graphs forenhanced retrieval[ 6].
However, such retrieval-centric approaches falter when compliance
hinges on deep structural logic. Figure 1 illustrates three recurrent
failure modes: missed cross -references, broken decision -tree logic,
and checklist conflation. First, for regulations with explicit cross-
references (see Figure 1(a)), which serve as key reasoning cues,
query-based retrieval often misses the reference chain by focusing
on query relevance over inter-chunk relationships [ 1]. Similarly,
when regulations follow a decision-tree structure (see Figure 1(b)),
end-to-end LLMs may omit necessary chunks or lose the logical

connection between nodes in the multi-hop path [ 7,33]. Third, for
checklist-style obligations (see Figure 1(c)), ambiguous or complex
contexts often confuse LLMs, leading to conflated lists and missed
or duplicated checks [1].
To address specific failure modes in structural reasoning, we
proposeGraphCompliance. Our framework constructs two knowl-
edge graphs (KGs) from policy documents and a given context: a
policy graphthat captures the logical structure of regulations, and
acontext graphthat formalizes the situational facts. These KGs are
aligned by acompliance gate, which performs deterministic struc-
tural analysis (e.g., reference traversal, exception chaining), before
presenting a constrained and simplified problem to the LLM. This
approach distinguishes our framework from prior work [ 6,11,35].
While our constructed KGs also enhance retrieval and serve as
a knowledge store, their primary function is to act as an active
reasoning scaffold: explicit structural lookups—such as traversing
cross-references or checking actor attributes—are handled by re-
liable graph traversal rather than the LLM’s general contextual
understanding. Consequently, the LLM is reserved for interpreting
nuanced semantic information and rendering the final judgment
on a pre-analyzed, structured input, tackling cases that contextual
similarity or enhanced retrieval alone struggle to resolve (Figure 1).
We instantiate the framework on a benchmark that links the
original regulatory text of the GDPR with real or synthetic scenarios,
enabling evaluation of compliance or non-compliance of regulatory
provisions. GDPR is an EU-wide privacy law governing personal-
data processing by controllers and processors; it sets principles and
lawful bases and grants data-subject rights (e.g., access, erasure) [ 1].
We construct a policy graph covering all articles of the GDPR and
assess regulatory compliance on a benchmark of 300 real-world-
inspired scenarios. Our evaluation includes overall accuracy, error
analysis, in-depth ablation studies on our framework’s submodules,
and extensive comparisons with baselines, demonstrating a 4.1–
7.2 pp F1 score gain over existing methods, including RAG and
GraphRAG [6, 16].The primary contributions of this work are as follows:
•A KG-based LLM framework specialized for regula-
tory compliance.A new end-to-end hybrid framework
specifically designed to address the structural and semantic
gap between normative regulations and real-world con-
texts.
•A new methodology based on dual-graph alignment.A
novel approach that models policy and context as separate
KGs and uses a ‘Plan-anchored compliance gate’ to align
them, thereby constraining the LLM’s reasoning process.
•State-of-the-art performance through empirical vali-
dation.Comprehensive empirical validation demonstrat-
ing asignificant accuracy gain up to 7.2 ppover strong

our core structural components.

2.1 Graph-based LLM Frameworks
A growing body of work integrates graphs with LLMs for evi-
dence organization, cross-document reasoning, and multi-hop re-
trieval [ 22]. Representative systems include GraphRAG, which
builds entity/community graphs and precomputes community “re-
ports” for query-focused retrieval and summarization [ 6]; Hip-
poRAG, which couples KGs with Personalized PageRank as a
structure-aware long-term memory for multi-hop QA [ 14]; G-
Retriever, which selects task-relevant subgraphs from textual and
attributed graphs [ 11]; MindMap, which aggregates evidence sub-
graphs prior to LLM-based reasoning [ 31]; and GraphReader, which
conditions the aggregation on graph signals for reasoning-as-
reading [ 19]. Beyond these, KG-centric RAG variants mitigate re-
trieval gaps and preserve inter-chunk structure via KG-guided ex-
pansion [ 35], text-to-subgraph retrieval [ 13], and subgraph-size
control [ 17]. In industry, KG-RAG has seen deployment [ 32]. In-
spired by GraphRAG’s graph rendering of text, we repurpose the

actor alignment, (ii) execute cross-references/exceptions in-graph,
and (iii) ask the LLM only for semantic judgments over a curated
policy-derived check plan.
2.2 Graph-Structured Planning and
Hierarchical Selection
Beyond flat retrieval, RAPTOR organizes corpora into a recursive
summary tree for hierarchical selection [ 26], while KG planning
derives stepwise plans to steer RAG [ 27,30]. These lines of work
primarily use graphs to structure selection and planning for LLMs.
We adopt this external structure for normative texts by modeling
regulations and contexts as policy and context graphs, and by exe-
cuting a deterministic compliance gate (cross-reference traversal,
actor alignment) before applying LLM-based semantic matching to
a constrained policy-derived check plan.
2.3 LLM-based Automation of Legal and
Regulatory Compliance
LLMs have been used to analyze privacy policies and compli-
ance artifacts. PolicyGPT frames privacy-policy classification us-
ing ChatGPT/GPT-4, and Rodríguez et al. report large gains with
ChatGPT/LLaMA 2 for scalable policy analysis [ 23,28]. Domain-
specialized legal LLMs (SaulLM-7B, Lawma-8B) show benefits
across analysis, classification, and generation [ 4,5]; PPGen targets
the automatic generation of GDPR-compliant policies [ 25]. For ver-
ification, PrivComp-KG combines an LLM (via RAG) with a GDPR
KG to align snippets to articles and execute SWRL checks, while
Compliance-to-Code compiles KG/schema-derived requirementsinto executable checks [ 8,18]. In software contexts, Alecci et al.
link Android code behaviors to privacy requirements [ 2], and Has-
sani studies LLM-based requirement extraction and conformance
checking across the GDPR and DPAs [ 10]. Most prior systems op-
erate on isolated text segments with limited cross-article/recital
reference tracking. We differ by (i) adopting a policy-agnostic KG
schema (premises and CUs), (ii) performing policy-guided context
normalization via strong/weak hypernyms, and (iii) executing a
compliance gate that performs meta-scope checks, actor alignment,
constraint/ condition tests, and cross-reference traversal before the
LLM’s semantic judgment.
3 Methodology
This section presents the three components ofGraphCompliance—
Policy Graph Construction, Context Graph Construction, and Com-
pliance Gate Reasoning. Figure 2 illustrates the end-to-end pipeline;
pseudocode for the main procedures appears in Appendix C.
Overview.(i)Policy Graph Constructionconverts regulatory
text into premises and compliance units (CUs), each formalized as
{𝑠𝑢𝑏𝑗𝑒𝑐𝑡,𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛𝑡,𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑥𝑡,𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛} , and links CUs with cross-
reference edges. (ii)Context Graph Constructionextracts entity–
relation (ER) triples from the scenario and maps entities to policy-
guided hypernyms. (iii) TheCompliance Gategroups policy-relevant
entities intoanchors(actor/data/system). For each anchor, it re-
trieves a top- 𝐾CU Plan, performs listwise LLM judgment using an
“evidence window,” applies a reference-edge override for exceptions,
and aggregates results at the article level.

3.1 Policy Graph Construction
The objective of this subsection is to detail our three-stage process
for converting unstructured regulatory text into a structuredpolicy
graph (𝐺𝑃): text classification, rule formalization, and relational
linking.
First, the regulatory text is segmented into semantic units (e.g.,
articles, clauses) and classified as either a contextualpremiseor
an actionablecompliance unit (CU). Here, apremisedenotes
non-deontic definitional or interpretive material—such as terms,
role definitions, scope statements, and purposes—that the sys-
tem must know to read the code but that is not itself judged
for (non)compliance; for consistency, we assign premises at the
article level. Each CU is then formalized into a 4-tuple schema,
𝑟=⟨𝑆,Θ,Π,𝜅⟩ , representing its subject ( 𝑆), constraint ( Π), context
(𝜅), and conditions ( Θ) [9,18]. We further distinguishactor-CUs,
which encode obligations, prohibitions, or permissions addressed
to a role-bearing actor (e.g., controller, processor, recipient) and
constitute the units actually judged in a case, frommeta-CUs, which
specify applicability (temporal/territorial scope, role qualification,
covered processing) and therefore gate whether an actor-CU should
be considered; meta-CUs are evaluated first and are not reported as
standalone violations. This classification and typing are performed
once, offline, by an LLM.
Finally, the CU nodes are interconnected by identifying cross-
references to form the graph structure. Our two-pronged approach
uses regular expressions forexplicit references(e.g.,“Article 5”)
and a small LLM to resolveimplicit, relative references(e.g.,
“paragraph 1”). This process creates relational edges like REFERS_TO ,
transforming the flat text into a policy graph ( 𝐺𝑃) that faithfully
preserves the regulation’s logical structure.
3.2 Context Graph Construction
The objective of this subsection is to detail the process of converting
unstructured real-world contexts—such as incident reports or logs—
into a structuredcontext graph ( 𝐺𝐶)that can be aligned with the
policy graph.
The first step in building 𝐺𝐶is to extract entities and their re-
lations as(𝑠𝑢𝑏𝑗𝑒𝑐𝑡,𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑐𝑎𝑡𝑒,𝑜𝑏𝑗𝑒𝑐𝑡) ER triples [ 12] from the un-
structured text. For this task, we employ the LLM-based ER-triple
extraction method proposed inGraphRAG[6].
The next step ishypernym mapping, which links the extracted
entities to the formal terms of the policy. While such conceptual
mapping is typically handled implicitly by an LLM’s internal repre-
sentations, we add this as an explicit process to make the mapping
transparent and stabilize downstream reasoning. To achieve this,
we use the previously built policy graph as retrieval information to
guide the mapping.
This policy-guided normalization proceeds as follows. Let 𝐻
denote the vocabulary of policy-level hypernyms derived from
the policy graph. For each context entity 𝑒, we retrieve the top- 𝑀
policy fragments via dense retrieval and elicit candidate hypernyms,
yielding a small set 𝐻𝑒⊆𝐻. Each candidate is treated as a proposal
𝑟=(𝑒,ℎ(𝑟),frag_id(𝑟),src(𝑟)) and is assigned an LLM-generated
confidence score 𝑠(𝑟)∈[ 0,1]. A proposal is markedSTRONGif
its supporting fragment is aPremise, andWEAKotherwise. Let 𝑅𝑒
denote the set of proposals associated with entity𝑒.Finally, since multiple proposals may exist for a single entity,
their scores are aggregated for each unique hypernym label using a
max-pooling approach that provides a bonus to STRONG proposals.
The aggregated confidence for a hypernym ℎ(per entity𝑒), denoted
b𝑠𝑒(ℎ), is
b𝑠𝑒(ℎ)=minn
1,max
𝑟∈𝑅 𝑒:ℎ(𝑟)=ℎ 𝑠(𝑟)+𝛽1{STRONG(𝑟)}o
,(1)
where𝑟is an individual proposal, ℎ(𝑟) is its hypernym label, and
𝑠(𝑟) is its LLM-generated confidence score. 𝛽is a small bonus hy-
perparameter (we set 𝛽=0.3in experiments).1 (𝑃)is the indicator
function:1if 𝑃is true, and0otherwise. We retain the top- 𝑁hyper-
nyms per entity according tob𝑠 𝑒(·)(we use𝑁=5). We denote
Φ𝑁(𝑒)=Top−𝑁
{(ℎ,b𝑠𝑒(ℎ)):ℎ∈𝐻 𝑒}
,(2)
where Top−𝑁 returns the 𝑁highest-scoringorderedpairs (sorted
byb𝑠𝑒(ℎ); ties broken bySTRONG >WEAK, then lexicographic ℎ).
Through this process, the context graph ( 𝐺𝐶) is finalized, with a
structure that includes the ER triples and, as a feature for each
entity, a list of normalized hypernyms.
3.3 Compliance Gate
Thecompliance gateis the core reasoning engine that takes the
constructed policy graph ( 𝐺𝑃) and context graph ( 𝐺𝐶) as inputs to
produce a final compliance judgment. The overall pipeline consists
of three main stages:(1) candidate retrieval and re-ranking,(2)
LLM-based judgment and exception handling, and(3) final
decision aggregation.
The reasoning process starts by retrieving candidate CUs from
𝐺𝑃for each factualanchorin 𝐺𝐶. We use a simple three-part bi-
encoder score for an anchor 𝑎and a CU𝑐: (i) similarity between
the anchor’s entity features and the CU’s subject, (ii) similarity
between the anchor’s hypernyms and the CU’s subject, and (iii) a
small bonus when any hypernym overlaps the CU’s subject terms.
Formally,
𝑆(𝑎,𝑐)=𝑤 ent⟨vent(𝑎),v subj(𝑐)⟩
+𝑤 hyp⟨vhyp(𝑎),v subj(𝑐)⟩
+𝑤 bonus 1
𝐻(𝑎)∩Subj(𝑐)≠∅	(3)
Here,𝐻(𝑎) is the set of hypernyms attached to 𝑎;vent(𝑎)and
vhyp(𝑎)are embeddings of the anchor’s entity and hypernym fea-
tures;v subj(𝑐)is a pre-cached subject embedding of 𝑐;1(𝑃)is the
indicator function; and Subj(𝑐) is the subject-term set of 𝑐. Taking
the top-𝐾 1CUs by𝑆(𝑎,𝑐)yields the broad candidate setC(1)
𝑎.
Next, this candidate set is refined by a more powerful but compu-
tationally intensive cross-encoder that jointly processes 𝑞(𝑎) and
𝑑(𝑐) to model deep interactions, following the standard re-ranking
practice in graph-augmented retrieval [11]. We construct
𝑞(𝑎)=[predicate;actor_type;object_type],
𝑑(𝑐)=[subject;constraint;condition],(4)
from the anchor and the candidate CU, respectively. The result of
this funneling process is a concise and highly relevantCU Plan—a
curated list of rules{𝑃 𝑖}𝐾
𝑖=1prepared for the final judgment.
In the second stage, the generated CU Plan and anevidence win-
dow—a local subgraph of 𝐺𝐶centered on the anchor—are passed to
an LLM for judgment. The initial judgment is performed in a listwise

𝐽: 𝑊(𝑎),{𝑃 𝑖}𝐾
𝑖=1↦→ {( ˆ𝑦𝑖, 𝑠𝑖,why𝑖,evid𝑖)}𝐾
𝑖=1.(5)
In the first LLM call, the judge holistically considers relationships
among candidate rules and, for each CU 𝑖, returns a compliance
label(ˆ𝑦𝑖), a confidence score (𝑠𝑖), a rationale(why𝑖), and evidence
(evid𝑖)simultaneously. Using a concise judge prompt, we restrict
reasoning to the retrieved ANCHOR and CONTEXT WINDOW, pri-
oritize explicit contradictions while allowing strongly implied ones,
and forbid inference from silence (ambiguous or out-of-scope cases
→INSUFFICIENT/NOT_APPLICABLE). To handle the complexity
of regulatory reasoning, we introduce a crucial post-processing
step for any judgment initially deemedNON_COMPLIANT. For
each violated CU ( 𝑐), we first compute itsreference closure R(𝑐)—
the set of all CUs reachable by traversing reference edges in 𝐺𝑃.
A second LLM call then determines whether any CU within this
R(𝑐)constitutes a valid exception that overrides the initial violation.
This override mechanism provides a practical implementation of
defeasible logic:
ˆ𝑦′
𝑐=(
COMPLIANT,if∃𝑟∈R(𝑐)s.t.IsException(𝑟,𝑊(𝑎))=true,
ˆ𝑦𝑐,otherwise.
(6)
Finally, we aggregate the (post-override) judgments to a single
verdict per article using aviolation-firstrule: if any CU linked to
an article is labeledNON_COMPLIANT, we report the highest-
confidence violation; otherwise, we return the highest-confidence
remaining label.4 Experimental Evaluations
This section presents our experimental design for validatingGraph-
Compliance. We first introduce the core research questions, de-
scribe the dataset, define the evaluation protocol, summarize the
baselines, and conclude with the experimental setup. Implementa-
tion details are deferred to Appendix B.1.
Research Questions (RQs).To systematically evaluate our frame-
work, we designed experiments guided by the following RQs:
•RQ1 (Accuracy and Robustness):DoesGraphCompli-
anceoutperform baselines, and are the gains consistent
across underlying LLMs?
•RQ2 (Submodule contribution):Which of the proposed
modules contributes most to the overall performance?
•RQ3 (Submodule fidelity):Are the generated graphs suf-
ficiently accurate and robust so as not to bottleneck end-to-
end performance?
•RQ4 (Prompt sensitivity):How sensitive is the frame-
work’s performance to variations in the Compliance Gate’s
prompts?
•RQ5 (Case-specific analysis):How does performance
vary across different regulatory topics (e.g., GDPR chap-
ters)?
Policy and Benchmark Dataset.We focus on the EU General Data
Protection Regulation (GDPR) as our primary regulatory corpus
and provide a brief overview in Appendix A. Although many policy
texts are publicly accessible, high-quality violation materials are
scarce and often encumbered by confidentiality and redistribution
restrictions—even for non-commercial research—making it chal-
lenging to adopt alternative benchmark datasets. Purely synthetic
Jiseong Chung, Ronny Ko, Wonchul Yoo, Makoto Onizuka, Sungmok Kim, Tae-Wan Kim, and Won-Yong Shin
narratives risk label drift and undermine external validity. Accord-
ingly, we curateGCS-3001, a semi-synthetic benchmark of 300
scenarios grounded in publicly documented enforcement decisions
and official guidance. Each scenario is (i) anchored by citations to
its source, (ii) anonymized and minimally abstracted to remove
identifying or sensitive details while preserving the legal facts, and
(iii) post-screened to remove outliers where anonymization could
blur the core lawful basis or violation theory. This pipeline yields
reproducible labels without compromising research ethics, but it
also makes broad, multi-policy benchmarking challenging in prac-
tice. We therefore treat GDPR as a focused, high-fidelity testbed and
leave cross-regulation evaluations to future work; the framework
itself is policy-agnostic by design.
Evaluation Protocol.We assess performance using a combination
of quantitative and qualitative metrics. For quantitative evaluation,
we report standard classification metrics, including macro-F1 and
micro-F1. To reflect practical utility in human-in-the-loop com-
pliance environments—where minimizing false negatives is crit-
ical—we also adopt theF2-score( 𝛽=2) as a key metric, which
weighs recall twice as heavily as precision. Because quantitative
metrics alone are insufficient to capture the quality of compliance
reasoning, we additionally employ an LLM-based rater—following
approaches such as [ 15,34]—to qualitatively evaluate whether
model rationales reflect sound legal reasoning. An ensemble of
three strong reasoning models scores alignment to the ground-truth
violation articles and lawful basis; scoring details are provided in
Appendix E.
Baselines.We structure comparisons along two orthogonal axes:
system designandmodel family. On the system side, we consider
(i) araw LLMsetup in which the GDPR text is provided directly in
the context window, (ii) avanilla RAGpipeline that retrieves the
top-8 most relevant chunks per prompt, and (iii) aGraphRAG-style
pipeline that builds a document-level graph over the GDPR and
retrieves multi-hop node/community summaries under the same
retrieval budget for parity. On the model side, we evaluateGPT-like
closed-weight families and7–8Bopen-weight models [ 5,20,21].
For Lawma-8B [ 5], which is tuned for multiple-choice prompting,
we reformulate the retrieved evidence into a multiple-choice query
(candidate articles/options) to match its interface. All baselines
share the same decision schema and task prompts (adapted only
to input format), and decoding is deterministic ( temperature =0.0).
Prior work that directly targets our setting—full-scope, article-level
regulatory compliance adjudication from unconstrained scenario
narratives with explicit violation attribution—remains scarce. Exist-
ing regulatory LLMs [ 4,5] are primarily designed for legal QA/sum-
marization rather than regulation-wide compliance gating, while
GraphRAG is a retrieval/organization framework rather than a task-
specific compliance judge. We therefore report comparisons against
the closest applicable systems under a unified evaluation protocol.
Experimental Setup.All experiments are conducted on ourGCS-
300benchmark using the GDPR as the policy text. Unless otherwise
1Due to research-ethics constraints, the GCS-300 dataset itself cannot be released. To
support reproducibility and transparency, Appendix D documents the full construction
protocol, and we additionally release a limited set of illustrative samples that can be
publicly shared.

specified,GPT-4.1in a zero-shot setting serves as the default under-
lying LLM for all RQs to ensure consistency [ 21]. All graph-based
methods utilize the same pre-constructed, single-version Policy and
Context Graphs. To ensure a fair comparison, all models and base-
lines share the same core prompts, with minimal adaptations only
to accommodate differences in their input schemas. An exception is
made for GPT-5–based systems to account for their distinct, overly
conservative response patterns; we uniformly add an emphasis
prompt to encourage predicting a violation when the evidence is
clear and to minimize free-form reasoning beyond the retrieved
evidence.
4.1 RQ1: Accuracy and Robustness
We evaluated the compliancejudgmentaccuracy ofGraphCom-
plianceon GCS -300 against Raw LLM, Vanilla RAG (Top -K=8/30),
and a GraphRAG -style pipeline, across both general -purpose and
domain -aligned LLMs. To ensure validity and fairness, we use a
unified decision schema in azero-shotsetting with deterministic
decoding ( temperature =0.0) and identical prompt scaffolding; all
graph-based methods share the same pre-generated policy/context
graphs. Retrieval budgets are matched, and Top -K is tuned on a
held-out validation set; no model-specific prompt tuning is applied.
When the GDPR corpus exceeds the context window, the raw-LLM
baseline runs in amulti-turn packingmode.
Results (Table 1) show thatGraphComplianceachieves clear
improvements across all models compared to a strong RAG baseline:
on GPT-like models, macro-F1 improves by +2–6 pp, F2 by +12–
20 pp (micro/macro), and MCC (Matthews correlation coefficient) by
+1–4 pp; on 7–8B open-weight models, macro-F1 rises by +2–4 pp
and F2 by +3–4 pp. GraphRAG does not yield a meaningful uplift
over RAG on this task; in head-to-head comparisons,GraphCom-
plianceoutperforms GraphRAG by up to +12.8 pp macro-F1 and
up to +19.6 pp F2 (and +11.1 pp MCC under Top -K=8 with GPT -4.1).
These trends indicate that structuring the problem and constrain-
ing reasoning with explicit, typed graph evidence provides more
reliable gains than scaling model size or merely graph -summarizing
retrieval; the effect holds for domain-aligned LLMs as well.Graph-
Complianceshows its largest gains on the F2, which weights recall
twice as much as precision ( 𝛽=2). This indicates a substantially

lower miss rate on true violations, i.e., the system is less likely to
overlook high-risk non-compliance. In human-in-the-loop com-
pliance workflows, such recall-oriented performance is desirable:
by reliably surfacing high-probability violations, the framework
supports risk-aware triage and shortens downstream audit and
remediation cycles.
4.2 RQ2: Submodule Contribution (Ablation
Study)
This RQ tests that performance gains arise from thecombinationof
modules rather than a single component. We conduct ablations by
removing one module at a time and measuring the degradation. To
ensure fairness when providing raw text as input, we construct a
“dummy graph” with the text as node content, preventing penalties
from prompt-schema differences. The variants ofGraphCompli-
anceare:
•S1 (Raw policy):Replace the Policy Graph with the raw
regulatory text, chunked at thepointlevel.
•S2 (Raw context):Replace the Context Graph with the
raw context description, treating the entire text as a single
anchor.
•S3 (E2E on graphs):Provide the full Policy and Context
Graphs as textual input, but without our structured anchor-
ing mechanism.
•S4 (No reference traversal):Disable explicit traversal of
cross-references between CUs.
As summarized in Figure 3, all proposed components contribute
critically to the final performance (further numerical details in
Appendix B.2). The largest drop (–10.2 pp) occurs in S2, where
the Context Graph is replaced with raw text; recall declines with
the loss of the highlighting effect from subgraph-based anchoring,Table 4: Paraphrase sensitivity on GPT-4.1. Lower 𝐹1range
indicates higher robustness. All values are micro-F1 scores.

which clarifies explicit hypernym information and isolates individ-
ual entities/actions. The sizable drop in S4 (–9.6 pp) confirms that,
for reference-dependent regulations such as the GDPR, explicit
reference linking via graph traversal is highly effective. The smaller
drop in S1 reflects that the anchoring effect from the Context Graph
remains, while the S3 result suggests that information overload
without anchoring harms reasoning. Overall, the superiority of
GraphCompliancestems from synergistic effects—particularly (i)
subgraph-based anchoring that clarifies actions and (ii) reference
traversal that follows the regulation’s logical flow.
4.3 RQ3: Submodule Fidelity
This RQ independently validates the fidelity of the two interme-
diate representations (the graphs), demonstrating that the final
judgment is built on a solid foundation rather than being jeop-
ardized by low-quality intermediate steps. Because a large-scale,
gold graph is unavailable, we design proxy evaluations. We first
conduct areconstruction testto evaluate information capture
in a single pass 𝑇0→𝐺 0→𝑇 1, where𝑇0is the initial text, 𝐺0
the generated graph, and 𝑇1the text reconstructed from 𝐺0. We
then extend to acycle-consistency testby iterating the transfor-
mation (𝑇𝑘→𝐺𝑘→𝑇𝑘+1) to check stability/invariance. Informa-
tion preservation is measured along two dimensions: (1)Semantic
Isomorphism, the similarity between 𝑇0and𝑇𝑘, and (2)Structural
Isomorphism, a comparison of graph-level statistics between 𝐺0and
𝐺𝑘. For semantic similarity between two sentence sets 𝐴𝑐and𝐵𝑐,
we use a symmetric max-similarity score𝑠 𝑐:
𝑠𝑐=1
2
E𝑎∼𝐴 𝑐
max
𝑏∈𝐵 𝑐cos(𝑎,𝑏)
+E𝑏∼𝐵 𝑐
max
𝑎∈𝐴 𝑐cos(𝑎,𝑏)
.(7)
where cos(·,·) denotes cosine similarity between unit-normalized
sentence embeddings. Finally, we validate that our isomorphism
scores are meaningful with anoise injection test: we corrupt
𝐺0to obtain𝐺′
0using a mixture of operators—randomly deleting
a fraction𝛿of edges, adding spurious edges, and altering CU at-
tributes—reconstruct text 𝑇′
1from𝐺′
0, and measure the drop in
semantic similarity relative to𝑇 0.
As shown in Table 2, both graphs exhibit high cycle-consistency.
For the policy graph, the semantic score shows negligible degra-
dation, starting at 0.8749 and remaining stable at 0.8691 after five
cycles, while the structural score remains near perfect ( >0.9997).
The context graph also shows high stability, with semantic sim-
ilarity stabilizing at 0.8516 after an initial drop from 0.9132. The
significance of these scores is corroborated by the noise-injection
results in Table 3: injecting just 10% noise ( 𝛿=0.10) lowers the se-
mantic score to 0.8231, notably below the Policy Graph’s noise-free

generation fidelity/robustness is sufficient and does not bottleneck
end-to-end performance, supporting the reliability of the gains in
RQ1 and RQ2.
4.4 RQ4: Prompt Sensitivity
This RQ validates that high accuracy in RQ1 is not an artifact of a
single “golden” prompt. We test robustness to prompt variations
in the Compliance Gate from two perspectives. First, to measure
syntactic robustness, we paraphrase the core judgment prompt into
several semantically equivalent variants and quantify the variability
using a𝐹1range, defined as 𝐹best
1−𝐹worst
1on micro-F1. Second, to
assess the role of in-context learning, we compare zero-shot, one-
shot, and two-shot settings while holding the graphs and context
fixed.
To this end, we evaluated the prompt sensitivity of the Com-
pliance Gate from two perspectives. First, to measure syntactic
robustness, we observed performance variations across several
semantically equivalent but syntactically different versions (para-
phrases) of the core judgment prompt. To quantify this variance, we
measure the difference between the best and worst micro-F1 scores
(i.e.,𝐹best
1−𝐹worst
1). This provides a direct and intuitive measure of
robustness that can be readily compared across different reasoning
frameworks. Second, to assess the impact of in-context learning,
we compared the performance of the same judgment task under
zero-shot, one-shot, and two-shot settings. This design is valid as it
isolates the impact of prompts and examples by keeping the input
graphs and context fixed.
Our results indicate thatGraphComplianceis highly robust to
prompt variations. As summarized in Table 4, both GraphCompli-
ance and the RAG-aided baseline demonstrated markedly higher
stability against prompt paraphrasing compared to the raw LLM
baseline. The 𝐹1range for GraphCompliance was low at 6.5 pp, a
level of stability comparable to the robust RAG-aided baseline (5.8
pp). This result supports that the high accuracy of GraphCompli-
ance reported in RQ1 is not an artifact of a single, favorably-tuned
prompt, but a robust finding. Meanwhile, the few-shot test results
in Figure 4 show that performance consistently improves with the
number of shots for all underlying models. This suggests that, in
addition to the rich contextual understanding gained from graphTable 5: Per-chapter performance analysis on GDPR Chapter

line for the final LLM onhowto perform the compliance judgment
itself. In summary, our framework achieves both high accuracy and
stability with minimal prompt tuning.
4.5 RQ5: Case-Specific Analysis
This RQ analyzeswhereandwhyour framework excels beyond ag-
gregate metrics by focusing on specific topic clusters. We compare
GraphComplianceto a raw LLM baseline on two representative
GDPR chapters: Chapters III (Rights of the Data Subject) and V
(International Transfers), across a large model (e.g., GPT-4.1) and 7–
8B models (e.g., SaulLM-7B, Llama-3-8B-Instruct). Because a single
scenario can trigger multiple articles within a chapter, we treat this
as a chapter-levelany-hit classification: a chapter is positive if
any of its articles is correctly identified. Performance is measured
usingRecallandFalse Positive Rate (FPR); due to the any-hit set-
ting, high recall is expected, making FPR crucial to over-prediction
tendencies.
The results, summarized in Table 5, reveal thatGraphCompli-
anceconsistently achieves higher Recall and substantially lower
FPR than the raw LLM baseline across all models and chapters.
This advantage is particularly pronounced forChapter V, whose
decision-tree-like normative structure is a natural fit for our graph-
based representation. Our framework’s ability to traverse explicit
references results in near-perfect Recall (99.2%) with a very low
FPR (4.4%) on large models, whereas the baseline struggles with the
complex logic, leading to a high FPR (52.2%). ForChapter III, base-
lines exhibited over-sensitivity to general terms like‘transparency‘,
leading to an overly defensive and noisy prediction pattern. In
contrast,GraphCompliance’s reliance on specific entity-subject
alignment avoids this pitfall. This analysis demonstrateshowour
structured approach improves reasoning: it excels at navigating the
explicit logical paths common in regulations and is more robust to
the keyword-based distractions that plague text-only models.
5 Conclusions and Outlook
This work proposes GraphCompliance to address the gap between
the structural complexity of regulatory texts and the unstructured
GraphCompliance: Aligning Policy and Context Graphs for LLM-Based Regulatory Compliance
nature of real-world contexts. The hybrid framework converts poli-
cies and contexts into a Policy Graph and a Context Graph, then
aligns them via a Compliance Gate to structurally guide the final
LLM-based judgment. Our experiments show that this structured,
neuro-symbolic approach significantly improves accuracy, robust-
ness, and fidelity over standard end-to-end baselines, offering a
path toward verifiable compliance automation.
Despite these promising results, limitations remain, pointing
to important directions for future work. Because the quality of
initial graph extraction directly impacts the final judgment, a key
challenge is to enhance the automation and robustness of graph
construction. We propose two major directions: first, extending
the framework to broader regulatory domains such as finance and
healthcare to validate its policy-agnostic design; second, design-
ing a more sophisticated agent network to reduce prompt depen-
dence. We believe this work provides a strong foundation for future
research into reliable and verifiable neuro-symbolic systems for
normative reasoning.

GraphCompliance: Aligning Policy and Context Graphs for LLM-Based Regulatory Compliance
A Concise Overview of the GDPR
The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR; Regulation (EU)
2016/679) is the European Union’s comprehensive legal framework
governing the processing of personal data of natural persons. The
instrument comprises 173 recitals and 99 articles arranged into 11
chapters, with definitions in Article 4 and extensive cross-references
that structure interpretation across provisions. At a high level, the
GDPR articulates foundational principles for lawful processing,
enumerates justifications for processing, confers enforceable rights
on data subjects, prescribes organisational and technical obligations
for controllers and processors, regulates international transfers, and
establishes independent supervision and remedies. The table be-
low summarises the chapter structure and principal subject matter
without methodological commentary.
Table 6: GDPR chapters and principal subject matter (articles
in parentheses).
Chapter (Arts.) Principal subject matter
Ch. 1 (1–4) General provisions; subject matter; material and territorial scope;
core definitions (personal data, processing, controller/processor,
etc.).
Ch. 2 (5–11) Principles of processing (lawfulness, fairness, transparency, pur-
pose limitation, minimisation, accuracy, storage limitation, integri-
ty/confidentiality, accountability); lawful bases; consent; special
categories; criminal data.
Ch. 3 (12–23) Rights of the data subject: information, access, rectification, erasure,
restriction, portability, objection; safeguards for automated decision-
making and profiling.
Ch. 4 (24–43) Controller and processor obligations: governance, contracts,
records, security of processing, breach notification, data protec-
tion by design/default, DPIA, DPO, codes and certification.
Ch. 5 (44–50) Transfers to third countries or international organisations: ade-
quacy decisions, appropriate safeguards (e.g., SCCs, BCRs), deroga-
tions, onward transfer conditions.
Ch. 6 (51–59) Independent supervisory authorities: establishment, tasks and pow-
ers.
Ch. 7 (60–76) Cooperation and consistency mechanism; one-stop-shop; European
Data Protection Board (EDPB) opinions and binding decisions.
Ch. 8 (77–84) Remedies, liability and penalties: complaints, judicial remedies,
compensation, administrative fines.
Ch. 9 (85–91) Specific processing situations: research and statistics, archiving
in the public interest, employment, expression and information,
national identifiers.
Ch. 10 (92–93) Delegated and implementing acts.
Ch. 11 (94–99) Final provisions: relationship with prior law, entry into force and
application.
Abbrev.: SCCs = Standard Contractual Clauses; BCRs = Binding Corporate Rules; DPIA = Data
Protection Impact Assessment; DPO = Data Protection Officer; EDPB = European Data Protection Board.
B Supplementary Experimental Information
B.1 Implement Detail
All experiments were run on a server equipped with NVIDIA RTX
Blackwell generation GPUs, running Ubuntu 22.04 and Python
3.11.9. The underlying LLMs tested include OpenAI’s GPT-4o, GPT-
4.1, GPT-5, and other publicly available models such as Llama-3-8B-
Instruct. For all LLM inferences, we used deterministic decoding
with temperature=0.0 and the text-embedding-3-large model
for embeddings, and enforced JSON object output where available.
Themax_output_token limit was set to at least 80% of each model’s
maximum capacity to prevent premature truncation. In cases where
a response was truncated by this limit, the partial generation was
forcibly parsed into a JSON object for analysis.B.2 Ablation study results

D GCS-300 Benchmark Construction and
Samples
This subsection describes the construction of the GDPR case-
based benchmark and how it is communicated. In compliance
with research ethics and source-specific licenses/reuse conditions,
we cannot release the full benchmark. Instead, to ensure trans-
parency and enable reproducibility, we first disclose the end-to-
end pipeline—collection, normalization, and labeling—in detail.
The benchmark further undergoes synthetic rewriting and de-
identification to meet research-ethics requirements. All prose and
labels are grounded infirst-party legal materials(e.g., judicial/ad-
ministrative decisions)(Labels are grounded in first-party legal ma-
terials).
We rely onfirst-partysources (DPA/court decisions and official
notices/press) as the basis for labels, whilesecond-party portals
(e.g., GDPRhub, Enforcement Tracker) are used solely as discovery
indexes. We do not quote their prose; labeling decisions are made
from first-party documents.
The construction pipeline is as follows: (1) public-web collection
with robots/TOS compliance; (2) normalization and de-duplication;
(3)LLM pre-digest: we useGPT-5 Thinkingto condense key facts
and candidate GDPR articles into a compact paragraph; (4)human-
in-the-loop reviewthat focuses on detecting anyomissions of
decisive groundsand amends the summary where necessary; (5) de-
identification and synthetic rewriting (removal/replacement of real
names and entities); (6) labeling ( violation ,violation_types ,
GraphCompliance: Aligning Policy and Context Graphs for LLM-Based Regulatory Compliance
articles ,lawful_basis ,risk_level ) with light cross-checks;
and (7) documentation (dataset-card style summary).
Regarding representativeness and bias, we took two concrete
measures. First, wemaximized the coverage of violated articles
so that a broad range of GDPR provisions appears in the distribu-
tion. Second, weflattened the sampling across timeto reduce
temporal skew (e.g., bursts by year or quarter). Any residual limita-
tions (e.g., jurisdictional or sectoral skew) are noted in the dataset
card.
The label set is defined concisely as follows. violation : scenario-
level binary judgment. violation_types : concise categories
(e.g., transparency_information ,international_transfers ).
articles : GDPR provisions directly linked to the case (e.g.,
Art. 9, Arts. 44–49). lawful_basis : legal bases for processing (e.g.,
consent ,legitimate_interests ).risk_level : overall risk (e.g.,
low/medium/high).Each label is assigned by mapping verifiable facts
to articles evidenced in first-party materials.
From an ethics/legal perspective, the public sample includes
no personal data and no real organisation names. To reduce
re-identification risk, we minimize rare attribute combinations;
details that cannot be shared are not included in the sample. Short
quotations are used only when necessary, with attribution.
The record below is asynthetic, de-identifiedexample that il-
lustrates the schema and labeling principles. While the labels are
grounded in first-party materials, the distributed text is adapted
and condensed to meet research-ethics requirements.

file will be ingested into our customer data platform to build
lookalike audiences and to retarget discharged patients on a

E Computation of Metrics
We reportmicro-F1,macro-F1,micro-F2,macro-F2(with 𝛽=2),
andMCCby directly linking predictions to the dataset labels. Gold
labels per scenario come from D violation.articles ; we frame
evaluation asarticle-level multi-label classification(set match be-
tween predicted and gold articles for each scenario).
Table 8: Formulas used in this paper ( 𝑃,𝑅: precision/recall;
𝛽=2). MCC is computed once on the flattened article-by-
scenario matrix.

Interpretation (what the scores mean).
•micro-F1: How precisely and completely the systempre-
dictsfrequent GDPR articles in practice.
•macro-F1: Whether the system also handlesrare (long-tail)
articles rather than only common ones.
•F2(𝛽=2): Higher micro-/macro-F2 means the system is
tuned toavoid missing severe violations(recall priority),
accepting some extra false positives.
•MCC: Overallbalanced performanceon violation and non-
violation labels under label imbalance—i.e., strong correla-
tion with ground truth without positive/negative skew.
Note on scale mismatch.Real cases may report points/paragraphs,
whereas we score at the article level; in practice, mismatches that
still map to the same parent article are rare. Any residual nuance is
further checked in the qualitativeLLM Rater.
