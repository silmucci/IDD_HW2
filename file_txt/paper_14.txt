Abstract
Multimodal approaches have shown great promise for searching
and navigating digital collections held by libraries, archives, and mu-
seums. In this paper, we introduce map-ras: a retrieval-augmented
search system for historic maps. In addition to introducing our
framework, we detail our publicly-hosted demo for searching 101,233
map images held by the Library of Congress. With our system, users
can multimodally query the map collection via ColPali, summarize
search results using Llama 3.2, and upload their own collections to
perform inter-collection search. We articulate potential use cases
for archivists, curators, and end-users, as well as future work with
our system in both machine learning and the digital humanities.
Our demo can be viewed at: http://www.mapras.com.

1 Introduction
Maps are key items for institutions that collect and preserve cultural
heritage [ 4]. They reveal historically significant insights into the
priorities, capabilities, and limitations of the societies that created
them, and so they serve as important subjects of research. The
Library of Congress (LOC), the world’s largest map collector, has
over 5.5 million maps [ 18]. Just over 10% are digitized, while a
quarter were received before machine-readable cataloging [1].
Searching the LOC’s Geography and Map (G&M) digitized col-
lection amounts to searching through textual metadata or text
extracted by optical character recognition (OCR). This method
requires thorough and accurate annotation of each searchable doc-
ument. Moreover, it misses features specific to visual data not cap-
tured in the metadata, and it is fixed to the pre-defined hierarchy ofmap items. Maps are particularly difficult to characterize because
they combine visual and textual elements, posing challenges for
traditional, unimodal machine learning solutions.
Recent advances in multimodal machine learning have made this
problem more tractable. The contrastive language-image pretrain-
ing (CLIP) model class [ 13] in particular allows a user to compare a
text prompt with a pre-computed corpus of image embeddings. By
returning the images whose embeddings are most geometrically
similar to the prompt embedding (i.e., nearest neighbors search),
CLIP can function as a search engine. However, the base CLIP model
struggles with text recognition [ 17], and its hard labeling resists
easy fine-tuning on similar-looking training data.
In this work, we apply the ColPali document-retrieval framework
[6] to the task of searching maps. Broadly designed as an aid in
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) settings, ColPali has several
properties that facilitate this task. Its soft similarity scores can better
handle visually similar items, and its multi-vector representations
can capture more complex relationships in data. As opposed to
models whose embeddings capture only global features, ColPali
can attend to specific regions of a document. This framework also
makes it easy for users to dynamically upload and add to their
corpus, a capability we call retrieval-augmented search (RAS).
In summary, we provide the following contributions:
(1)We introduce retrieval-augmented search, a variant of RAG,
for cultural heritage collections, and we present a demo for
101,233 map images held by the Library of Congress. Our
demo can be found at: http://www.mapras.com.
(2)We elaborate on use cases of our map retrieval-augmented
search system and detail future directions for our research.
(3)We release our code at https://github.com/j-mahowald/
mapras.

2.1 Library of Congress Maps
As our use case, we use the LOC G&M’s digital collection of 563,698
unique “segments” (unique images) divided among 57,962 “resources”arXiv:2510.25718v1  [cs.IR]  29 Oct 2025

(composite items). A small sampling can be found in Figure 1. Items
contain anywhere from one to 11,981 segments (though most are
small, with median 2 segments per item), and metadata is recorded
at the item level. These maps span centuries, as well as domains,
from geography and topography to historical analysis.
Of the 563,698 images, 439,947 (78% of segments), belong to the
collection of Sanborn fire insurance maps, which provide granular
data on urban building infrastructure and land use [ 11]. Because
these are easily indexable by metadata, we restrict our tool to the
approximately 100,000 non-Sanborn maps in the Library’s digital
collection that return valid calls.
The G&M online catalog is broadly searchable via metadata
facets including collection, keyword, location, and time period.
Each individual catalog entry can be viewed for each map, along
with information about the creation and context.

and Santa Fe, NM (1882), showing landmarks, street layouts,
and historical buildings.
2.2 ColPali
ColPali offers two base models: the original ColPali built on Google’s
PaliGemma (a 3-billion-parameter vision-language model) [ 3], and
ColQwen built on Alibaba’s Qwen2 VLM (2 billion parameters)
[6]. Both models use multiple patch embeddings to capture details
across different sections of a page. ColQwen generates 768 patch
embeddings per page, while ColPali generates 1024, though both
use the same embedding dimension of 128. We use ColQwen in this
implementation to reduce comptutational costs.
2.3 Multimodality and Digital Humanities
While map collections are routinely utilized by researchers across
disciplines, searching maps oftentimes suffer from fundamental
limitations [ 10]. For example, map metadata is never completely
descriptive, and neither is the OCR-able text appearing on a given
map. Given the sheer scale of digitized maps available, developing
new ways to search these maps is more important than ever.
This paper builds on work in the digital humanities that has
demonstrated the value of multimodal search for digital collections
held by libraries, archives, and museums. Deemed the “multimodal
turn” [ 15], models such as CLIP [ 13] have shown great promise
for increased discoverability for digital collections ranging from
photojournalism collections [ 8] to lantern slides [ 14]. This paper
extends our previous work surrounding applying CLIP to digitized
maps for search & discovery, informed by the perspectives of staff
at the Library of Congress [ 12]. However, as described earlier, CLIP
struggles with text recognition, especially with longer passages.
For this reason, we have adopted ColPali.
Figure 3: A full flow chart of our 3-stage pipeline. Red shapes
indicate direct interface with the user, while blue diamonds
are models loaded onto the server. The embeddings corpus
is the only persistent object at 28GB.
A number of other works have begun exploring the application of
ColPali to digital cultural heritage [ 5,9,16]. In addition to applying
ColPali, we utilize Llama 3.2 [ 7] to generate summaries of search
results, in line with RAG-style search.
3 Method
Our fast and reusable retrieval-augmented search engine is moti-
vated by the task of searching map data for cultural institutions:
(1)First, to ensure accessibility for resource-constrained insti-
tutions, the tool should create high-quality embeddings of
complex visual data quickly on consumer-grade hardware.
The method should be available for practitioners who want
to implement it on their own data.
(2)It should embed several modes into a common latent space
to enable comparison between them.
(3)Because maps have both visual and textual data, it should
distinguish between sections of a single document and parse
them individually, rather than create a single global embed-
ding.
(4)It should allow users to easily add new items to the corpus
as they come up.
As shown in Figure 3, our method follows three stages: data
preparation, embedding generation, and search interface deploy-
ment. We describe all three stages below.
Retrieval-Augmented Search for Map Collections
Figure 4: Search on a non-LOC image results in visually simi-
lar images taken from the LOC’s corpus. Analysis highlights
details on the results taken from metadata.
3.1 Data Preparation
Working from a central CSV file, we download batches of 500 images
sequentially, accumulating them in temporary storage and process-
ing them in sub-batches to respect GPU memory constraints. In
keeping with cultural heritage norms, we work in the International
Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF) throughout our pipeline.
3.2 Embedding Generation
Working in batches, we embed each image in the corpus using the
pre-trained ColQwen2 model. On a single NVIDIA T4 Tensor Core
GPU, a single embedding processes in 3 to 4 seconds, with its model
requiring 5.62GB of GPU memory.1Each embedding is put into
a dictionary with its unique IIIF identifier, which can be used to
reference relevant metadata from the master CSV. Embeddings are
saved at the batch level in distributed pickle files.
3.3 Search Interface
Once a base set of embeddings is processed, we deploy a Flask-based
REST API that loads all distributed embeddings into memory on
startup. The API exposes several endpoints for corpus management
and querying, with the primary search endpoint accepting POST
requests containing a natural language query string and a parameter
𝑘specifying the number of results to return (default: 5).
Query processing follows the late-interaction paradigm: the
user’s text query is embedded using the same ColQwen2 model,
then scored against all document embeddings using the processor’s
MaxSim computation, which determines the maximum similarity
between each query token vector and all document patch vectors,
1On an AWS g4dn.4xlarge instance, this requires 75 hours of total compute, amount-
ing to approximately$90dollars.

like illustrations of ships that do not appear in the items’
metadata.
preserving fine-grained semantic matching while remaining com-
putationally tractable at the scale of the corpus.
In Figures 4 and 5, we show a screenshot of an example search,
along with several top results. Results are ranked by similarity score
and returned with metadata including the document title, the image
itself, the ‘loc.gov‘ API resource, the document type, and numerical
score. Response times for queries against our corpus of 25,000+
embedded images average under one second after the initial model
load, making the system suitable for interactive exploration.
On a server with a single NVIDIA T4 Tensor Core GPU for AI
inference, submitting a query through the 120,000-item embedding
corpus takes roughly 6 seconds. Indeed, inference time grows lin-
early with corpus size, demanding new techniques for small-scale
inference once corpus size exceeds a few hundred thousand. We
leave this for future work.

3.3.1 Image search.Because vision-language models embed visual
and textual data to a common embedding space, the tool can easily
accept input images for a reverse-image-search functionality. After
images are processed, this follows the same scoring regime as text-
to-image search. Notably, the model does not transfer between
modes in this case, and the similarity scores between an image
query and its result tend to be an order of magnitude higher than
between a text query and its result.
3.3.2 Retrieval-augmented Search Framework.Our implementation
follows a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approach that al-
lows dynamic expansion of the corpus. Users can augment the base
set with their own documents, whether from partner institutions’
IIIF servers, local digitized materials, or PDF publications, during or
between search sessions. These personalized search contexts allow
a user to compare their own materials to those of the corpus, and
to customize the search engine for their own uses.
More broadly, persistent corpus expansion allows institutions
to collaboratively build federated search indices, where multiple
organizations contribute embeddings from their collections without
centralizing the underlying image files, respecting data sovereignty
while enabling cross-institutional discovery.
All additions, regardless of origin, are processed through the
identical ColQwen2 embedding pipeline, projected into the same
128-dimensional vector space, and scored using the same late-
interaction mechanism. This ensures that user-contributed ma-
terials are semantically comparable to the base corpus.
3.3.3 LLM Analysis.Lastly, we include a feature that allows a user
to generate qualitative LLM analysis on the results of their search.
After a search is completed, the pipeline extracts metadata from the
search result, formats it into a prompt, and passes it to a lightweight
Llama 3.2-1B, which provides short, digestible information on the
major themes, time periods, formats, subjects, and authors of the
results. Analysis typically runs for 5-15 seconds, depending on the
number of results requested.
4 Use Cases
We envision our retrieval-augmented search system for large-scale
map collections to have a number of uses for both collection cura-
tors and end-users. On the curatorial side, archivists, curators, cata-
logers and collection stewards responsible for digitizing collections
and providing access to them typically rely on traditional manual
methods of cataloging and producing finding aids. This process is
time-intensive, especially for larger-scale collections, such as the
ones held by the Library of Congress. Put simply, approaching the
scale of half a million map images necessitates additional methods
to draw connections across a digital collection. With our retrieval-
augmented search system, archivists, curators, and catalogers can
identify patterns at scale and also interact with the collection in
new, multimodal ways. They can test hypotheses about the preva-
lence of different features during finding aid construction and also
make associations that otherwise might not be possible by relying
on existing metadata. As digitization efforts continue to grow, and
born-digital collections approach orders of magnitude larger, such
methods will only become more important.Similarly, end-users from academic researchers to members of
the public face the challenge of how to make sense of large-scale
digital collections. Academics searching map collections for specific
motifs, aesthetic qualities, or accompanying text might encounter
the analogous problem with existing forms of search. Our system
enables end-users to define more flexible queries, generate relevant
summarizations, and more generally see collections at scales not
possible with basic metadata search (i.e., “distant viewing” [2]).
Lastly, we highlight the possibilities for integratinginter-collection
search. As described in Section 3.3.2, our system enables others
to dynamically expand the collection included. The possibilities
with this dynamic corpus expansion functionality are manifold.
First, archivists and collection stewards can utilize this approach to
searchacrosscollections that are ordinarily siloed. Second, digital
humanities scholars can use this approach for exploratory analysis
in order to identify similarities and differences between collections.
Third, as articulated in Section 3.3.2, we see a broader vision of
enabling the multi-institutional construction of federated search
indices using these vectorized approaches.
5 Future Work
We conclude by offering a few directions for future work. First, we
plan to expand our retrieval-augmented search system into a full
vision language model-based RAG system by generating summaries
based on what the model finds from the map images directly, not
just the map metadata. Second, we will explore finetuning ColPali
for specific use with digital cultural heritage collections. Third, we
hope to expand our system into a more flexible system for searching
a range of digital cultural heritage collections, as well as conduct
user evaluations of it. We encourage users to visit http://www.
mapras.com and test their own prompts, and welcome feedback.
