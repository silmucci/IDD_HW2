Abstract
Sequential recommendation models must navigate sparse interac-
tion data, popularity bias, and conflicting objectives like accuracy
versus diversity. While recent contrastive self-supervised learning
(SSL) methods offer improved accuracy, they come with trade-offs:
large batch requirements, reliance on handcrafted augmentations,
and negative sampling that can reinforce popularity bias. In this
paper, we introduce BT-SR, a novel non-contrastive SSL framework
that integrates the Barlow Twins redundancy-reduction principle
into a Transformer-based next-item recommender. BT-SR learns
embeddings that align users with similar short-term behaviors
while preserving long-term distinctions—without requiring nega-
tive sampling or artificial perturbations. This structure-sensitive
alignment allows BT-SR to more effectively recognize emerging
user intent and mitigate the influence of noisy historical context.
Our experiments on five public benchmarks demonstrate that BT-
SR consistently improves next-item prediction accuracy and sig-
nificantly enhances long-tail item coverage and recommendation
calibration. Crucially, we show that a single hyperparameter can
control the accuracy-diversity trade-off, enabling practitioners to
adapt recommendations to specific application needs.

1 Introduction
Sequential recommendation models have demonstrated impressive
performance by capturing the rich temporal dynamics inherent
in user–item interactions across many recommender system do-
mains and applications. Transformer-based [33] architectures re-
main the state of the art [24, 26, 17] thanks to their ability to model
long-range dependencies and complex sequential patterns in users’
consumption histories. However, the extreme sparsity typical for
such behavioral data often hampers these models’ capacity to learn
robust user representations from limited interaction information.
Real-world sequential recommender systems must contend with
several intertwined problems. First,popularity biasskews recom-
mendations toward a small subset of “short-head” items. It marginal-
izes long-tail content and reduces overall catalog coverage. Second,
metric trade-offsforce practitioners to balance conflicting objectives
such as precision versus recall, short-list accuracy versus long-list
engagement, or accuracy versus novelty, therefore making one-size-
fits-all solutions impractical. Third, achieving truepersonalizationrequires reconciling short-term session dynamics with stable long-
term user preferences, a tension that often leads to either myopic
or overly generic suggestions. Finally,diversificationis essential to
avoid repetitive item sequences and to expose users to a broader
range of content, yet naive diversification can compromise rele-
vance.
To address the sparsity issue, recent work has integrated con-
trastive learning (CL), a class of self-supervised learning (SSL) meth-
ods, into sequential recommenders [35, 27, 11, 23]. By pulling to-
gether augmented views of the same user sequence and pushing
apart different sequences, these methods can substantially boost
recommendation accuracy. Yet contrastive approaches introduce
new challenges: (1)popularity-based negative samplingcan exacer-
bate popularity bias [3], reducing novelty and catalog coverage and
reinforcing a feedback loop that disproportionately favors already-
popular items; (2) acquiring high-quality negatives demandslarge
batch sizes, inflating memory and computational overhead [28, 20];
and (3)representation collapse[14], where embeddings become
overly similar, diminishing the model’s expressivity.
Conversely,non-contrastive self-supervised methodshave recently
achieved remarkable results in computer vision [5] and natural
language processing [31] without relying on negative samples [40].
Among these, the Barlow Twins framework [38] stands out: it jointly
enforces invariance to perturbations and reduces redundancy across
embedding dimensions.
Applied to sequential recommendation, Barlow Twins can help
learn diverse, informative user representations with far lower com-
putational cost and without sampling negatives. By explicitly min-
imizing redundancy across embedding dimensions, the learned
representations can better capturevaried aspectsof user behavior,
which is critical for increasing recommendation diversity and long-
tail coverage. However, the potential of this approach has not been
fully studied in prior recommender system literature, which sets
the basis of the current work.
This research investigates the application of non-contrastive
learning principles to enhance sequential recommender systems.
Specifically, we address the following research questions: (i) can
non-contrastive learning produce higher-quality user embedding
spaces than contrastive learning within the recommendation do-
main? (ii) does non-contrastive learning effectively mitigate popu-
larity bias in recommendations? (iii) how sensitive are the resulting
recommendations to the hyperparameters of the non-contrastive
loss function?
This paper presents BT-SR (Barlow Twins for Sequential Recom-
mendation), the first framework to systematically adapt the Barlow
Twins redundancy-reduction objective to next-item prediction. Our
approach augments a standard Transformer-based recommender
with an auxiliary Barlow Twins loss that (i) enforces invariancearXiv:2510.26407v1  [cs.IR]  30 Oct 2025
Razvorotnev et al.
under sequence augmentations and (ii) discourages redundant fea-
tures in the embedding space. By tuning the relative weight of this
loss, BT-SR enables practitioners to shift recommendation behav-
ior—balancing precision on head items against long-tail coverage,
and short-list accuracy against long-range engagement—without
sacrificing overall accuracy.
Our main contributions are:
•A multi-task Transformer architecture:We seamlessly
integrate the Barlow Twins redundancy-reduction objective
with next-item prediction in a unified training loop.
•Controllable recommendation behavior:We show how
a single hyperparameter in BT-SR steers the model along
the spectrum of popularity bias—trading off precision on
head items versus enhanced coverage of long-tail items, and
balancing short-list versus long-list metrics. This controlla-
bility enables system designers to align recommendation
behavior with application-specific goals.
•Reduced popularity bias and improved calibration:
Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that BT-SR
not only mitigates over-recommendation of popular items
but also produces more confident and better-calibrated pre-
dictions.
Extensive empirical studies on several benchmark datasets con-
firm that BT-SR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art sequential
recommenders and contrastive-learning alternatives.

2.1 Transformers and Self-Supervised Learning
in Sequential Recommendation
SASRec [17] and BERT4Rec [32] pioneered the application of Transformer-
based architectures to sequential recommendation. These models
have since become the de facto standard due to their capacity to
capture long-range dependencies and encode rich user intent rep-
resentations. Subsequent research has focused on refining their
architectural and training components, including attention mecha-
nisms, positional encodings, and optimization objectives [26].
To mitigate data sparsity and enhance representation learning,
recent advances have integrated self-supervised learning (SSL) into
Transformer-based recommenders. A predominant line of work
follows the contrastive learning (CL) paradigm, wherein positive
views are generated via data augmentations and pulled closer in the
embedding space, while negatives are repelled. CL4Rec [35] intro-
duced four canonical augmentation strategies—cropping, reorder-
ing, masking, and substitution—whereas DuoRec [27] proposed
target-aware augmentations to preserve user intent and sequence
semantics. Further refinements, such as CBiT [11] and SCL [30],
have incorporated bidirectional attention mechanisms and embed-
ding uniformity regularization to stabilize optimization and im-
prove generalization.
Despite their empirical success, CL-based frameworks suffer
from several intrinsic limitations. First, their reliance on negative
sampling incurs additional computational cost and often introduces
popularity bias [3]. Second, their performance exhibits high sensi-
tivity to batch size and temperature hyperparameters [28], making
them less robust in large-scale or imbalanced recommendationsettings. These challenges have motivated growing interest in non-
contrastive self-supervised paradigms that eliminate the depen-
dency on explicit negatives.
2.2 Next-item Prediction Objectives
To establish a principled baseline for our next-item recommendation
model, we build upon the SASRec architecture and systematically
compare three loss formulations—binary cross-entropy (BCE), full
softmax cross-entropy (CE), and scalable cross-entropy (SCE). Each
objective exhibits distinct trade-offs between predictive accuracy,
optimization stability, and computational scalability. Below, we for-
malize these objectives and discuss their respective characteristics.
We first formulate next-item recommendation as a binary classi-
fication problem and optimize the binary cross-entropy loss:
LBCE(𝜃)=−∑︁
𝑢∈U"𝑛∑︁
𝑡=2log𝑝𝜃(𝑖𝑢
𝑡,𝑡)+∑︁
𝑗∈𝑆𝑢,𝑡log 1−𝑝𝜃(𝑗,𝑡)#
,(1)
where
𝑝𝜃(𝑖,𝑡)=𝜎 𝑟𝜃(𝑖,𝑡), 𝜎(𝑥)=1
1+𝑒−𝑥,
and𝑆𝑢,𝑡⊂I denotes a set of negative samples (items not yet inter-
acted with by 𝑢before step 𝑡). In practice, one or a few negatives
are drawn per step to approximate the full objective.
Recent work has demonstrated that replacing SASRec’s binary
cross-entropy with the full softmax-based cross-entropy substan-
tially improves next-item prediction accuracy by framing the task
as a multinomial logistic regression problem. Given the scoring
function𝑟𝜃(𝑖,𝑡), the probability of recommending item 𝑖at step𝑡
is expressed as
𝑝𝑐
𝜃(𝑖,𝑡)=softmax 𝑟𝜃(𝑖,𝑡)  over all𝑖∈I,(2)
yielding the cross-entropy objective
LCE(𝜃)=−∑︁
𝑢∈U𝑛∑︁
𝑡=2log𝑝𝑐
𝜃 𝑖𝑢
𝑡,𝑡.(3)
While this formulation achieves superior predictive performance,
computing the full softmax over the entire item catalog incurs
𝑂(|U|·𝑁) time and space complexity, which becomes intractable
for large-scale recommendation systems. Sampling-based approxi-
mations or partial normalization strategies thus remain essential
for scalability.
To address this computational bottleneck, [24] proposed the Scal-
able Cross-Entropy (SCE)—a state-of-the-art approximation that
replaces the full normalization term with a dynamically sampled
candidate set. LetC𝑢,𝑡⊂I denote a subset containing the true next
item𝑖𝑢
𝑡and𝐾negative samples drawn uniformly or from a learned
proposal distribution. Then,
𝑝𝑠
𝜃(𝑖,𝑡)=exp 𝑟𝜃(𝑖,𝑡)
Í
𝑗∈C𝑢,𝑡exp 𝑟𝜃(𝑗,𝑡) 𝑖∈C𝑢,𝑡,
and the corresponding sampled cross-entropy loss is given by
LSCE(𝜃)=−∑︁
𝑢∈U𝑛∑︁
𝑡=2log𝑝𝑠
𝜃 𝑖𝑢
𝑡,𝑡.(4)
By constraining the normalization to the sampled candidate set C𝑢,𝑡,
SCE reduces both time and memory complexity to 𝑂(|U|·𝐾) per
update, thereby enabling efficient training on catalogs with millions

of items. In this study, we combine the Barlow Twins regularization
term with each of the BCE, CE, and SCE objectives to assess its
influence across different backbone–loss configurations.
2.3 Non-Contrastive Learning for
Representation Learning
Non-contrastive self-supervised learning (NCL) aims to learn in-
variant and discriminative representations without relying on ex-
plicit negative samples. Representative NCL frameworks include
BYOL [13], SimSiam [6], VICReg [2], and Barlow Twins [37]. These
methods employ architectural asymmetries—such as stop-gradient
operations, momentum encoders, or prediction heads—and objective-
specific regularizations, including redundancy reduction and vari-
ance normalization, to avert representational collapse.
Although these paradigms have achieved remarkable success
in computer vision and have recently been extended to NLP [31],
their application to recommender systems, and particularly to se-
quential models, remains relatively underexplored. Existing efforts
primarily adopt an offline pretraining–fine-tuning pipeline: for in-
stance, CLUE [7] adapts BYOL for collaborative filtering through
offline self-supervised pretraining, and SelfCF [23] integrates self-
supervision into non-sequential matrix factorization models.
The most relevant prior work, NCL-SR [39], extends non-contrastive
learning to sequential recommendation; however, it relies on ex-
ternal side information to construct augmented views and lacks a
systematic analysis of model controllability and representation be-
havior. In contrast, our BT-SR framework introduces a unified multi-
task training scheme that integrates the Barlow Twins objective
directly with the next-item prediction loss, enabling controllable
redundancy reduction during training.
Furthermore, recent work [22] employed the Barlow Twins ob-
jective for SSL-based pretraining followed by fine-tuning on down-
stream recommendation tasks, including next-item prediction. We
argue that such a two-stage pipeline is suboptimal for the rec-
ommendation domain: (i) SSL pretraining is substantially more
time-consuming than joint multi-task optimization, and (ii) the
multitask setup, wherein the Barlow Twins loss functions as a reg-
ularizer, allows for explicit control over recommendation diversity
and behavioral bias through a single hyperparameter. This prop-
erty is central to our contribution and will be further discussed in
subsequent sections.
3 Proposed Approach
The challenges outlined in Section 1—such as popularity bias, per-
sonalization trade-offs, and embedding sparsity—are rooted in how
user interaction sequences are represented. Transformer-based se-
quential recommenders rely on fixed-length embeddings to summa-
rize user histories, but these embeddings often struggle to balance
two critical goals: capturing shared short-term intent and preserv-
ing user-specific long-term preferences. This imbalance leads to
brittle recommendations, especially in sparse or skewed data set-
tings.
In this section, we introduceBT-SR, a non-contrastive learn-
ing framework that enhances sequence embeddings by reducing
feature redundancy and promoting invariance under meaningful
augmentations. We first formalize the problem setting and describethe next-item prediction objective used as a base task (Section 3.1).
Next, we introduceour supervised augmentation strategy, which
defines semantically meaningful views of user sequences(Section 3.2).
Finally, we present the Barlow Twins loss as an auxiliary objective
that encourages redundancy reduction and representation align-
ment across augmented views (Section 3.3).
3.1 Problem Setup and Preliminaries
We consider a standard sequential recommendation setting where
the goal is to predict the next item a user will interact with, given
their past behavior. Let Udenote the set of users and I={𝑖 1,...,𝑖𝑁}
the catalog of items. Each user 𝑢∈U has a chronological interac-
tion sequence:
𝑆𝑢= 𝑖𝑢
𝜋𝑢
1,𝑖𝑢
𝜋𝑢
2,...,𝑖𝑢
𝜋𝑢
|𝑆𝑢|,
where𝜋𝑢
𝑡indexes interactions by timestamp. The goal of sequential
recommendation is to learn a function that, given the 𝑛most recent
items from 𝑆𝑢, accurately predicts the next item. Formally, the
model is trained to maximize the likelihood
𝑃𝜃 𝑖𝑢
𝑡|𝑖𝑢
𝑡−𝑛,...,𝑖𝑢
𝑡−1,(5)
where𝜃denotes model parameters.
In practice, this is implemented by encoding the user history at
moment𝑡in the form of the item sequence 𝑠𝑢(𝑡)=[𝑖𝑢
𝑡−𝑛,...,𝑖𝑢
𝑡−1]
into a representation 𝑧𝑢(𝑡)=𝑓𝜃(𝑠𝑢(𝑡))using a Transformer encoder.
The next-item prediction task is then formulated as a classification
problem based on the relevance scores over the entire item catalog.
The scoring function is typically defined in a matrix-factorization
style as a scalar product between an item embedding 𝑒𝑖from the cat-
alog and the current sequence state: 𝑟𝜃(𝑖,𝑡)=𝑒⊤
𝑖𝑧𝑢(𝑡). We denote
the classification loss asL pred.
As baselines, we use SASRec variants trained with binary cross-
entropy (BCE), full softmax cross-entropy (CE), and scalable sam-
pled softmax (SCE), described in detail in Section 4.1.
While effective for optimizing next-item accuracy, these objec-
tives do not explicitly encourage structural alignment across se-
mantically similar user sequences. In what follows, we introduce an
augmentation scheme designed to reveal such alignment, followed
by an auxiliary redundancy-reduction objective that strengthens
the representational structure of the embedding space.
3.2 Designing Supervised Augmentations
To induce semantically meaningful alignment between users, we
design a supervised augmentation scheme guided by the next-item
label. Inspired by prior work on label-guided contrastive learn-
ing [27], we construct augmentations based on shared recent be-
havior. Specifically, given an anchor sequence 𝑆𝑢=[𝑖𝑢
1,...,𝑖𝑢
𝑡]
ending with target item 𝑖𝑢
𝑡, we uniformly sample another sequence
𝑆𝑢′from the training set whose final item is also 𝑖𝑢
𝑡. These two se-
quences, though originating from different users, reflect convergent
behavioral patterns that are likely to lead to the same recommen-
dation target.
We treat such sequence pairs (𝑆𝑢,𝑆𝑢′)as positive examples for
the Barlow Twins loss. This encourages the model to produce sim-
ilar embeddings for distinct consumption paths that converge to
the same intent, while still allowing diversity across user histories.
Razvorotnev et al.
Crucially, we avoid applying random augmentations (e.g., mask-
ing, cropping, dropout-based perturbations), as we find that they
introduce noise and diminish performance in our multi-task, non-
contrastive setup.
This augmentation strategy is natural for the next-item predic-
tion task and emphasizes behavioral convergence as a signal for
alignment, allowing the model to generalize across different inter-
action paths while preserving user-specific information.
We avoid synthetic augmentations (masking, cropping, dropout)
proposed in [36], as they introduce stochastic noise, harm stabil-
ity in our non-contrastive multi-task setup, and do not provide
controllability in recommendation behavior.
3.3 Redundancy-Reduction-Based
Regularization
Building on the behavioral alignment provided by our augmenta-
tion scheme, we now define a redundancy-reduction objective that
enhances the quality of sequence embeddings by promoting feature
diversity and invariance. This objective, based on the Barlow Twins
(BT) framework, is integrated as an auxiliary loss in our multi-task
training setup.
Let𝑍𝐴and𝑍𝐵denote the original and augmented batches of se-
quence embeddings produced by the backbone network. We assume
both views are ℓ2-normalized and mean-centered across the batch.
We applyℓ2normalization instead of the learned projection head
originally used in the BT framework, as it is parameter-free and
empirically more stable. The cross-correlation matrix C∈R𝐷×𝐷is
computed as
𝐶𝑖𝑗=1
𝐵𝐵∑︁
𝑏=1𝑍𝐴
𝑏,𝑖𝑍𝐵
𝑏,𝑗√︃Í𝐵
𝑏′=1(𝑍𝐴
𝑏′,𝑖)2√︃Í𝐵
𝑏′=1(𝑍𝐵
𝑏′,𝑗)2,(6)
where𝑏indexes samples in a batch of size 𝐵, and𝑖,𝑗index em-
bedding dimensions. Each 𝐶𝑖𝑗∈[−1,1], with 1 indicating perfect
correlation and -1 indicating perfect anti-correlation.
The corresponding BT loss is composed of two terms:
L𝐵𝑇=𝐷∑︁
𝑖=1(1−𝐶𝑖𝑖)2+𝜆𝐷∑︁
𝑖=1𝐷∑︁
𝑗=1
𝑗≠𝑖𝐶2
𝑖𝑗,(7)
where𝜆trades off invariance against decorrelation. Driving the
diagonal elements of 𝐶toward 1 enforces perturbation invariance,
while pushing the off-diagonal elements toward 0 reduces redun-
dancy.
We now define the complete loss function used to train BT-SR,
combining next-item prediction with redundancy reduction in a
single multi-task objective:
Ltotal=L pred+𝛼L BT,(8)
whereLpredis the standard next-item prediction loss and LBTis
the Barlow Twins redundancy-reduction loss. The hyperparameter
𝛼modulates the influence of self-supervised regularization during
training.
This formulation enables the model to learn embeddings that
are both robust to behavioral variation and structurally expres-
sive. As shown in Section 5, tuning 𝛼allows practitioners to steer
recommendation behavior in a controllable and interpretable way.Table 1: NDCG@10 performance comparison of three SAS-
Rec variants (BCE loss, CE loss, Scalable CE loss) with and

4 Experimental Setup
Datasets.We follow the experimental protocol proposed in [24] for
benchmarking backbone architectures. Experiments are conducted
on five public datasets: Behance [16], Kindle Store [25], Yelp [1],
Gowalla [8], and MovieLens-1M [15]. Users and items with fewer
than five interactions are filtered out. To prevent temporal leakage,
we adopt a timestamp-based split strategy [12]. A global times-
tamp at the 0.95 quantile of all interactions defines the boundary
between training and test data: interactions before this point form
the training set, and users with subsequent interactions (excluded
from training) constitute the test pool. For each test user, we apply
a standard leave-one-out protocol, using the latest interaction for
testing and the second-to-last interaction for validation. All experi-
ments are conducted on a single NVIDIA A100 GPU. The code and
preprocessing scripts are publicly available1.
Metrics.Following best practices [4, 9, 19], we evaluate models
using unsampled top- 𝐾ranking metrics computed over the full
item catalog. We report Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain
(ndcg@K) and Hit Rate (hr@K) for 𝐾=1,5,10,50 , averaged across
all test users. To assess recommendation diversity, we report item
coverage (cov@K), defined as the fraction of unique items appearing
in top-𝐾recommendations across all users. In addition to ranking
and coverage metrics, we analyze the structure of learned user
embeddings using theeffective rank[29]. Given the singular values
𝜎1,𝜎2,...,𝜎𝐷of the user-embedding matrix (obtained via singular
value decomposition), we normalize them as 𝑝𝑖=𝜎𝑖/Í𝐷
𝑗=1𝜎𝑗and
define the effective rank as the exponential of the Shannon entropy:
𝑟eff=exp
−𝐷∑︁
𝑖=1𝑝𝑖log𝑝𝑖
.(9)
A higher𝑟 effindicates a flatter singular-value spectrum and there-
fore a more diverse, less redundant embedding space.
Hyperparameters.All models are implemented in PyTorch and
optimized with Adam using a learning rate of 0.001. The maximum
sequence length is fixed to 50, truncating longer histories to the
most recent interactions. L2 weight decay is applied for regular-
ization, with the coefficient tuned on the validation set (typically
10−4–10−5). We perform a grid search over the Barlow Twins hy-
perparameters 𝛼and𝜆, selecting values from {0.05,0.10,..., 0.50}
based on validation performance. The auxiliary loss L𝐵𝑇is applied
to different SASRec variants trained with LCE,LScalable CE [24], and
LBCE[18]. We report the best-performing model for each dataset.

To ensure statistical significance, we report the mean and standard
deviation over five independent runs. Significance is verified using
paired t-tests ( 𝑝<0.05) against the second-best baseline, with sta-
tistically significant improvements marked by an asterisk (*). The
low observed variance demonstrates the stability of our method.
4.1 Baselines
As baselines, we adopt SASRec variants trained with: (1) binary
cross-entropy (BCE) [17], (2) standard cross-entropy (CE), and (3)
scalable cross-entropy (SCE) [24]. For contrastive-learning base-
lines, we include CL4SRec [36], DuoRec [27], and EC4Rec, anexplanation-guided contrastive framework that leverages training
gradients to identify positive and negative items [34].
While recent LLM- and LoRA-based recommenders perform well
in text-rich or cold-start settings, they underperform in ID-based
domains and incur substantially higher inference costs. Moreover,
prior studies [10, 21] show that large language models often mem-
orize public recommendation datasets, raising concerns of target
leakage rather than genuine generalization. For these reasons, we
exclude LLM-based baselines from our evaluation.

5 Results
We first evaluate the impact of adding the Barlow Twins term to
three SasRec objectives ( L𝐵𝐶𝐸,L𝐶𝐸,L𝑆𝐶𝐸). As shown in Table 1, the
Barlow Twins term consistently improves performance across all
base losses in the multi-task setup, demonstrating the universality
of our approach.
Next, we select the best-performing objective for each dataset.
L𝑆𝐶𝐸achieves the strongest results on Gowalla and Kindle Store,
whileL𝐶𝐸performs better on the remaining datasets. Using these
selected models, we compare against strong baselines on the hold-
out test set. Table 2 reports our best variant (BT-SR), which consis-
tently outperforms all baselines in both utility and coverage across
most datasets. To further investigate the role of the Barlow Twins
loss in representation learning, we provide a detailed analysis in
the following section.
5.1 Analysis
5.1.1 What Drives BT-SR’s Outperformance?
Although BT-SR achieves only modest coverage gains on Movie-
Lens and Amazon Beauty—remaining below the second-best base-
line—it delivers substantially higher coverage on the other three
datasets. To unpack this behavior, we split each item corpus into
three popularity-based buckets (each containing roughly one-third
of total interactions), ordered from most to least popular. Figure 1
shows HR@1 and HR@10 for each bucket.
Surprisingly, BT-SR underperforms slightly at HR@1 in the top-
popularity bucket, yet it markedly outperforms all baselines on
the mid- and low-popularity buckets—evidence of its enhanced
personalization. Moreover, BT-SR also leads at HR@10 even for the
most popular items, indicating thatit can elevate niche items into
top-rank positions without sacrificing performance on blockbusters.
Figure 2: (left) Comparison of score density distributions for
positive and negative candidate pairs across three datasets.
We quantify model’s confidence in distinguishing relevant
candidates by the histogram overlap factor (Overlap)—lower
values indicate better separation. (right) Singular value spec-
tra of the sequence embeddings for each dataset, annotated
with their computed effective ranks (in legend), illustrate the
effective dimensionality of the learned representations.
This pattern highlights how the Barlow Twins loss both prevents
representation collapse andmitigates popularity bias.
Further, in Section 5.4 we demonstrate that BT-SR can be further
tuned for industrial applications via an optional hyperparameter
that explicitly balances HR@1 against HR@10—allowing practi-
tioners to prioritize the metric that best suits their use case.
5.1.2 Can non-contrastive learning produce higher-quality user em-
bedding spaces than contrastive learning in recommendation?
Our method outperforms contrastive learning (CL) baselines, not
only demonstrating greater effectiveness but also suggesting that
it learns higher-quality user embeddings.
We compared the score distributions for positive (ground-truth)
and negative items. Figure 2 shows that BT-SR consistently assigns
higher scores to positive items than competing models across three
datasets. This confirms that our approach sharpens user represen-
tations and more clearly distinguishes true preferences from noise.
To analyze the embedding geometry, we performed singular
value decomposition (SVD) on each set of user embeddings and
plotted their singular-value spectra (Figure 2). We then computed

the effective rank (Eq. 9) to quantify the flatness of the singular-
value spectrum. On Yelp and Gowalla, BT-SR produces a flatter
spectrum, whereas on MovieLens the spectrum is steeper.
5.2 Ablation Study
To analyze the balance between the primary recommendation loss
and our Barlow–Twins regularizer, we performed a hyperparameter
sweep over 𝛼∈ { 0.0,0.1,0.2,0.3,0.4,0.5},where𝛼=0effectively
removes the BT term in Equation 8. We also evaluated sensitivity
to the decorrelation weight 𝜆in Equation (11). To isolate each
effect, we first fixed 𝜆at its optimal value and varied 𝛼, and then
held𝛼constant while sweeping 𝜆. Figures 3 and 4 plot (i) hit-rate
metrics ( hr@1,hr@5,hr@10) and (ii) coverage@ 𝐾as functions of
𝛼. Additional ablation studies are available in Appendix A.
When𝛼≤0.1, the model favors a short, high-precision recom-
mendation list: hr@1and hr@5peak, while coverage remains low.
As𝛼increases, precision at top-1 drops by only 2–3 pp, but hr@10
improves and coverage@10 nearly doubles. In effect, 𝛼acts as a
dial between ashort-list/high-precisionmode and along-list/high-
diversitymode.
To further dissect this trade-off, we studied metrics for 3 item-
popularity buckets. Figures 4 and 3 show hr@𝐾and coverage@ 𝐾
within each bucket as 𝛼varies. At low 𝛼, almost all hits come from
Figure 4: Parameter sensitivity wrt𝛼for MovieLens dataset.
Left: common metrics, Right: item-popularity bucket metrics.
Picture demonstrates controllability of recommendations via
hyperparameter.
Bucket 1 and Bucket 3 performance is near zero. As 𝛼exceeds 0.2,
performance in Buckets 2 and 3 rises sharply (e.g., coverage@10
in Bucket 3 grows from 0 to 0.015), while Bucket 1 performance
declines only modestly.
We observe the same qualitative behavior on Yelp, Gowalla,
and Amazon Beauty: a low- 𝛼regime tuned for head-item precision
versus a high- 𝛼regime that enhances long-tail coverage. MovieLens
(ML-1M), however, shows weaker bucket separation: decreasing
𝛼improves head-bucket metrics but degrades both mid- and tail-
bucket performance in tandem. We attribute this to the extreme
interaction skew in MovieLens, which makes our uniform bucket
split conflate heterogeneous user subgroups and obscure the head-
vs-tail trade-off.
We further demonstrate the practical aspect of this effect on
Figure 5. We provide two setups of our BT-SR method with two
different values of 𝛼on the Yelp dataset. Both setups allow outper-
forming the baseline in terms of integral recommendations accuracy
yet they yield completely different internal structure of recommen-
dations with respect to item popularity. As demonstrated in the
figure, one can select between two regimes. In one regime, corre-
sponding to the lower value of 𝛼, the recommendations are steered
towards more generic user interests, which is indicated by a higher
performance in the first bucket in terms of hr@1metric. In contrast,
Razvorotnev et al.

the BT-SR method on the Yelp dataset under two regimes:
𝛼= 0.1favors popular items (high HR@1), while 𝛼= 0.4
promotes diverse, less popular items early in the list, boost-
ing personalization and maintaining high overall accuracy
(HR@10).

the second regime with higher 𝛼compensates for lower scores in
the first bucket by a better performance in the second and third
buckets, thus promoting less popular yet relevant recommendations
at the beginning of the recommendation list. It helps increasing the
diversity of recommendations without compromising the overall
accuracy and boosts personalization.
In summary, our framework not only improves overall recom-
mendation quality but also exposes a single, intuitive hyperparam-
eter𝛼that practitioners can tune to balance short-list precision
against long-tail diversity. In practice, we find that moderate values
of𝛼(e.g., 0.2–0.4) offer the best balance across datasets.
Impact of Augmentation Strategy.We next assess the im-
pact of our behaviorally aligned augmentation strategy. Following
prior contrastive learning approaches such as CL4SRec [35], we
experiment with perturbation-based augmentations (e.g., random
masking, cropping, and reordering). However, we observe that
these noise-based augmentations lead to performance degradation
in our non-contrastive, multi-task setting. We further evaluate item-
based augmentations on the YELP and Kindle Store datasets and
find a performance drop of at least 6%. These findings support our
choice of goal-preserving augmentations derived from user intent,
as described in Section 3.2.
6 Conclusion
We introduce BT-SR, a novel integration of the Barlow Twins
redundancy-reduction objective into Transformer-based sequential
recommenders. BT-SR outperforms six strong baselines, mitigates
popularity bias, and produces sharper, more discriminative user
embeddings. Moreover, our method allows adapting to different
trade-offs between accuracy and diversity of recommendations,
therefore better suiting various user engagement scenarios used in
real applications. These results demonstrate that non-contrastiveself-supervision offers a compact, effective pathway toward fairer,
high-performing recommendation models.

A Ablation Study
Figure 6 presents the complete results of our ablation study on the
parameters 𝛼and𝜆from Equations 7 and 8. Specifically, we set
𝛼=0to entirely remove the Barlow Twins term from the training
loss and𝜆=0to eliminate the decorrelation term.
For sensitivity analysis, we first fix 𝛼to its optimal value and vary
𝜆to assess its impact on invariance. Similarly, we fix 𝜆and adjust
𝛼to analyze sensitivity with respect to decorrelation. The results
demonstrate that both invariance and decorrelation play crucialroles in learning generalizable user representations for sequential
recommendation (SR).
We observe dataset-dependent optimal configurations for 𝛼and
𝜆. More interestingly, tuning these parameters allows control over
recommender behavior, such as the trade-off between the quality
of long-tail and short-head recommendations. For instance, on
Gowalla, the maximum HR@1 is achieved with 𝛼= 0.5, while
HR@10 peaks at 𝛼=0.1. Additionally, increasing 𝛼significantly
improves Cov@K on YELP and Gowalla. The popularity bucket
metrics further (Figure 8) reveal that 𝛼can be adjusted to balance
recommendation quality across different popularity segments.
