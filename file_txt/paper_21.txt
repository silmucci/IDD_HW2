 The Nigeria's oldes t degree -granting university is  University of Ibadan (UI), founded in 1948 as 
an external College of the University of London and converted to an independent University in 
1962. Located in Ibadan, the capital of Oyo State, UI has grown to become a premier institution 
in Nigeria and Africa, renowned for its academic excellence and research contributions 
(Adebowale, 2015) . The Arts, Science, Medicine, Agriculture, and Social Sciences are just a few 
of the faculties at UI that provide a broad range of undergradu ate and graduate degrees. The 
university's strong academic standards and extensive curriculum, which are intended to educate 
students in a wide range of professional sectors, demonstrate its commitment to education 
(Adeniyi, 2019). UI has produced several eminent alumni over the years who have made major 
contributions to various areas worldwide. The university is home to the Kenneth Dike Library, one 
of the largest and most resourceful libraries in Nigeria. Named after the university's first African 
vice-chancellor, the library plays a critical role in supporting the institution's academic programs 
by providing access to vast collections of books, journals, and electronic resources (Ogunruku, 
2018) . The library's extensive holdings and modern facilities make it an essential component of 
UI's academic environment.  
 Research is an important part of the University of Ibadan's mission. Among the research centres 
and institutions that are part of the school are the Institute of African Studies, the Center for 
Sustainable Development, and the Institute for Advanced Medica l Research and Training.  These 
centers support multidisciplinary research that tackles regional and global issues, making a 
substantial contribution to the corpus of knowledge across multiple disciplines (Falola & 
Adebayo, 2016) . The University of Ibadan' s impact extends beyond academia. It plays a pivotal 
role in community development through various outreach programs and partnerships with local 
and international organizations. These initiatives aim to address social issues, improve public 
health, and enh ance educational opportunities in the region (Akinyemi, 2017) . UI's engagement 
with the community underscores its commitment to societal development and its role as a catalyst 
for change. The university's campus spread over 1,000 hectares, provides a condu cive environment 
for learning and research. It features modern classrooms, laboratories, and residential facilities, 
ensuring that students and staff have the necessary resources to excel. Additionally, the university's 
emphasis on extracurricular activiti es, including sports and cultural events, contributes to the 
holistic development of its students (Olayinka, 2020) . In conclusion, the University of Ibadan 
stands as a beacon of academic excellence in Nigeria and Africa. Its rich history, commitment to 
research, and active engagement with the community highlight its role as a leading institution 
dedicated to fostering knowledge and development. As UI continues to evolve, it remains focused 
on its mission to provide quality education and contribute to societ al advancement.  
 
Literature Review  
In a research article, a review of the literature is crucial because it gives a thorough background 
that places the current topic within the framework of what is already known. It identifies gaps, 
trends, and key findings in the field, ensuring that the research is built on a solid foundation. By 
synthesizing relevant studies, the review helps to justify the research questions and objectives, 
demonstrating the study's significanc e and relevance. Moreover, it allows researchers to avoid 
redundancy, build upo n previous work, and position their contributions within the broader 
academic discourse. In scientometric studies, the literature review is particularly crucial as it 
enables the identification of influential works, emerging topics, and collaboration patte rns, 
ultimately guiding the direction and impact of the research.

 Ahmad and Batcha (2020), titled "Lotka’s Law and Authorship Distribution in Coronary Artery 
Disease Research in South Africa", examines the applicability of Lotka’s Law to the authorship 
patterns in this field. Using publication data from the Web of Scienc e for the period 1990 -2019, 
the study analyzes 1,284 research papers authored by South African scientists. It applies 
bibliometric tools and statistical tests, including the Kolmogorov -Smirnov test, to assess the fit of 
Lotka’s Law. The findings reveal tha t while the general distribution of authorship follows Lotka’s 
inverse square law, the specific parameters for South African CAD research do not perfectly align, 
highlighting deviations in author productivity. The study underscores the importance of locali zed 
analysis in bibliometrics. Huang and Chang (2020) explored the research productivity of leading 
universities in the United States using scientometric indicators. Their study highlighted variations 
in publication output and citation impact across differ ent institutions, with a focus on the influence 
of research funding and institutional support on academic performance. A bibliometric analysis of 
research performance in UK universities was carried out by Jones and Thomas (2019). According 
to the study, citation impacts and research visibility were higher at universities with robust 
international cooperation and interdisci plinary research projects. Gupta and Kumar (2021) used 
scientometric methods to evaluate the research productivity of Indian educational institutions. 
Their findings indicated significant growth in research output over the past decade, with notable 
increases in collaborative publications and international co -authorships. Lin and Chen (2018) 
performed a comparative scientometric study of res earch output in major Asian universities. They 
identified key research trends, institutional performance metrics, and collaboration patterns, 
revealing a growing emphasis on global research networks and high -impact publications. 
Gonzalez -Brambila et al. (2 017) applied scientometric methods to evaluate the research 
performance of Latin American universities. Their study showed an increase in publication output 
and collaboration with international researchers, though with varying levels of citation impact 
across different institutions. Butler and Morrison (2016) conducted a bibliometric mapping study 
of research output in Australian universities. Their analysis revealed significant trends in research 
focus areas, collaboration networks, and the impact of insti tutional policies on research 
productivity. Al -Shehri (2020) performed a scientometric assessment of research productivity in 
universities across the Middle East. The study highlighted increasing research output and 
collaboration with international researc hers, particularly in scientific and technical fields. Katz and 
Martin (2015) analyzed research collaboration patterns in universities using scientometric 
methods. Their study highlighted the positive impact of international and interdisciplinary 
collabora tions on research productivity and impact. Ivanov and Popov (2016) performed a 
bibliometric review of research performance in Russian universities. The analysis indicated a 
growing trend in publication output but a need for improvement in citation impact a nd international 
collaboration. Demir and Aydin (2019) conducted a scientometric evaluation of research trends in 
Turkish universities. Their study revealed significant growth in research output and international 
collaborations, with variations in citation  impact across different institutions. Lee and Choi (2021) 
compared research impact in universities from emerging and developed nations using 
scientometric methods. The study showed that universities in developed countries generally had 
higher citation imp acts, though emerging nations were rapidly increasing their research output and 
international visibility. Andersson and Nilsson (2020) evaluated the research performance of 
universities in Scandinavia using scientometric indicators. The analysis revealed s trong research 
productivity and high citation impacts, supported by robust institutional policies and funding.

 universities. Their findings indicated an increase in research output and collaborations but 
highlighted ongoing challenges in achieving global research impact. Ahmad (2022)  explored 
scientometrics investigation on coronary artery disease research among BRICS countries and has 
revealed that continuous rapid growth was found from 1990 to 2019. Also, the collaboration of 
country -wise and year -wise collaborative research is in an  increasing trend. The majority of the 
work on coronary artery disease by scientists preferred to publish their research papers in journal 
articles. From the study, it has been revealed that the People's Republic of China contributed the 
highest productivi ty of articles and the lowest publications contributed by South Africa among the 
BRICS Countries for three decades. English is, by and large, the medium of research 
communication, for it is widely recognized worldwide. In the study, multiple authorship pat terns 
are dominant compared to single author productivity in the BRICS Countries on coronary artery 
disease research publications. El -Khoury and Kassem (2018) reviewed research output and impact 
in higher education institutions across the Arab world using scientometric methods. The study 
revealed growth in research productivity and international collaborations, with varying levels of 
citation impact.

 database (e.g., Web of Science). TGCS score reflects the overall impact of a publication in the 
global research community. TLCS represents the number of times a paper has been cited by other 
papers within the same dataset or collection being analyzed.  
Table II lists the total number of citations, average citations per year (TCpY), and number of papers 
produced by different authors each year. The data also contains the number of citations each author 
has gotten, the number of citations their publications  have received, and the average number of 
citations each year. The preceding table shows the distribution of publications by year from 2014 
to 2023. There was a divergence in the growth of publications starting in 2014. Ten years later, 
1048 papers —out of 7159 total —have been published, the most noteworthy of which is 2023. The 
University of Ibadan published 7159 publications in a variety of areas between 2014 and 2023, 
according to Web of Science databases. Based on the study shown in Table II, there was a  variance 
in the publication rate between 2014 and 2023. The year 2023 had the greatest rate, followed by 
2021, 2022, and 2020. More than 60% of the articles were available throughout these four years, 
with 2023 making up the largest contribution with 7.55 % of all publications. During this time, 
7159 publications had 218572 citations found. There has been a discernible rise in the number of 
citations each year. The most citations occurred in 2023 (14.64%), 2021 (13.77%), and 2022 
(13.28%) following closely behind. Citations had increased significantly over the preceding four 
years, as determi ned by calculating the citation growth rate.

It looks at several different parameters to gauge the influence of different writers. A scientist or 
scholar's productivity and citation impact are gauged by their h -index. A scientist's productivity 
and impact are gauged by their g -index, which takes into consideration the quantity of highly 
referenced publications they have published. As indicators of an author's influence, the TC (total 
citations) and NP (number of publications) are also provided. The authors' lists were arranged in 
the table a ccording to h -index, but it's vital to remember that different metrics might provide 
varying perspectives on an author's effect. As a general rule, it's best to take into account multiple 
metrics in order to obtain a full picture.

Table IV examines multiple metrics to quantify the influence of sources. A scientist or scholar's 
productivity and citation impact are gauged by their h -index. A scientist's impact and productivity 
are gauged by their g -index, which takes into consideratio n the quantity of highly referenced 
publications they have published. The TC (total citations) and NP (number of publications) are 
also included as metrics of an author’s impact. The table provided lists the authors in descending 
order of h -index, with the  Lancet having the highest h -index ( 66), followed by PLOS One with an 
h-index of (21) and Heliyon having the lowest (12). However, when looking at other metrics such 
as the g -index, the Lancet has the highest g -index (86) then followed by PLOS One , (31) and 
Energy has the lowest (16). It is important to note that different metrics can provide different 
perspectives on an author’s impact, and it is usually recommended to consider multiple metrics to 
get a more complete picture.

The countries with the highest number of publications and associated authors are listed in Table 
VIII. The SCP and MCP metrics, respectively, count the number of single corresponding authors 
and multiple corresponding authors. The MCP ratio and frequency s hed information on the 
contributions to the field made by writers from different countries. Additionally, it displays the 
distribution of the most pertinent nations according to the relevant writers. Twenty countries' worth 
of output was examined in terms of articles, articles percentages, SCP, MCP, and MCP 
percentages. With 3753 papers (52.4%) published between 2014 and 2023, Nigeria has the most 
publications followed by the USA with 646 articles (9%), the UK with 371 pieces (5.2%), and 
South Africa with 2 41 articles (3.4%).

Figure 4 
As Figure 4 illustrates, Nigeria and the United States as have the highest number of corresponding 
authors. The United States has 646 papers with corresponding authors, while Nigeria has 3753 
articles. This indicates that research in both countries has MCP  ratios that are greater than normal, 
indicating a higher likelihood of multiple related authorships for authors from both countries. The 
list emphasizes how multidisciplinary research is. The countries on the list are from many 
continents; for instance, S outh Africa, Canada, China, Germany, India, Australia, Brazil, and 
Ghana all have writers that match. This demonstrates the broad spectrum of research, from medical 
applications. Therefore, this list of nations and their corresponding authors sheds light on the 
worldwide significance of collaborative research. It also demonstrates the multidisciplinary nat ure 
of research and the need for international collaboration among scholars to investigate its possible 
uses.

 cooperative relationship between groups, whereas the larger nodes reflect the dominating nation. 
The degree of cooperative relationships among the countries is shown by the distance between the 
nodes and the thickness of the links. The three countries that  contributed most significantly to 
research at the University of Ibadan were Nigeria, the US, and the UK. The fourth most influential 
nation in the creation of a cooperative network was South Africa. To promote future international 
cooperation and informat ion exchange, it appears that the policies fostering cooperation with these 
nationally key countries need to be changed.
